+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figs 1, 2 and 5. Specifically,
In the right MOR panel of Fig 1A, the density of background noise just below the results presented in lanes 1–2, and the density of background noise immediately surrounding the band in lane 4 do not appear to match the background density elsewhere in the blot.
In the third MOR panel on the left side of Fig 2A, the VAAGL + Morphine 60 Min result appears to be missing from the panel.
In the third MOR panel on the right side of Fig 2A, when levels are adjusted, there appears to be a vertical irregularity suggestive of a splice line between the results presented in lanes 6–7.
In the third pS133CREB panel of Fig 5A, when levels are adjusted, there appear to be vertical irregularities suggestive of splice lines between the results presented in lanes 1–2 and lanes 6–7.
The first author confirmed that the VAAGL + Morphine 60 Min result was inadvertently cropped out of the published Fig 2A MOR panel and provided a replacement figure. However, the first author disagreed with the concerns raised with the Fig 1A and Fig 2A MOR panels and the Fig 5A pS133CREB panel, stating that each panel was obtained from a single blot and the observed irregularities were likely due to image compression artifacts.
The first author provided image data to support the contested western blot results in this [1] and other PLOS ONE articles [2–5]. Per PLOS’ assessment of the data files, the pixel patterns in background areas of blot images provided for multiple panels in [1–5] appear more similar than would be expected for data obtained in independent experiments. The first author stated that the repetitive features in the background noise of the underlying data are likely the result of scanner artifacts.
During PLOS’ assessment of the underlying data, it was noted that neither the published panels nor the image data for the Fig 2A middle left MOR panel included a positive control. The absence of a positive control to confirm a successful western blot calls into question the reliability of results presented in this panels. In addition, the editorial assessment of the image data provided for the Fig 5A middle pS133CREB panel did not match the panel presented in the published figure.
The data and comments provided to PLOS did not resolve the concerns about the integrity and reliability of the reported data. In light of these issues, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The authors did not agree with the retraction. HYW stands by the article’s findings.

9822616,+Manipulation of Images,"The above article from The EMBO Journal, published online on 16 November 1998, has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal Chief Editor and Head of Scientific Publications, EMBO, Bernd Pulverer, and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. The authors’ and editors’ statements are as follows.
Authors’ statement
The corresponding author was alerted through the PubPeer website to pixel pattern duplications in Figures 5B and 6I of this paper. The Figures address the identification of the 2b protein of cucumber mosaic virus as a viral suppressor of silencing.
The pixel pattern duplications originate from the incorrect use of image editing software to cover background marks. The image editing was done by O. Voinnet without the involvement or knowledge of other co-authors. It involves regions of Figures 5B (Mock/GFP probe and CMV/CXMRNA2 probe) and 6I (TXMV-2bΔ GFP probe) that are required for assessment of the data.
The identification of 2b as a suppressor of silencing was a valid interpretation of the original experiments, but the original data are not available for correction and the authors accept that integrity of the scientific literature requires retraction of the article. The silencing suppressor role of 2b has been confirmed in different laboratories. The analysis of the HCPro silencing suppressor in this paper is unaffected by the duplications in Figures 5B and 6I.
All authors concur with this statement and wish to apologize for having allowed the incorrect images to be published in The EMBO Journal.
Editors’ statement
We alert readers to the fact that a number of related papers are also subject to a corrigendum or to a retraction. At The EMBO Journal, these encompass:

The Council of The Sainsbury Laboratory fully accepts the results of the investigation carried out by The University of East Anglia regarding figures that appear in this publication from the PhD thesis of Prof. Olivier Voinnet. – Prof. Nicholas Talbot, Executive Director and former Chair of Council, The Sainsbury Laboratory. ""The University of East Anglia has concluded a thorough investigation into concerns raised in January 2015 about possible research misconduct in Professor Olivier Voinnet's PhD thesis awarded in 2001. This investigation was conducted with the full cooperation of Professor Voinnet and concluded that the matter relates to a minor breach of University Regulations on conduct in research for two figure panels and to some figure mounting errors for the remaining parts of the thesis. The investigation found no evidence of dishonesty and confirmed that the thesis' conclusions remain unaffected. The outcome of the investigation was that an addendum to the thesis would be supplied by the author, and be reviewed and approved by appropriate internal and external examiners. This addendum was reviewed in this way and approved by the University in 2017, and was added to the public access copies of the thesis held by the University Library and British Library - September 6th 2018.
Congratulations to EMBO J for the transparent and no-nonsense explanation of what happened:

This possible ""mock-up"" Figure 6i also somehow found its way into Voinnet's PhD thesis, page 134:
This response is from Cyril Zipfel, Head of The Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL):
TSL has been made aware recently of irregularities reported on PubPeer concerning several papers authored by a previous researcher in the laboratory. As a leading institution in the field of molecular plant-microbe interactions, we are taking this situation extremely seriously. Together with the Head of our Scientific Council, we are actively discussing with all other institutions concerned to define the best way forward to co-ordinate efforts to clarify how these irregularities occurred and to take appropriate measures. I would like to acknowledge the immediate actions taken by Senior scientists at TSL, both past and present, to address concerns reported on PubPeer in relation to previous papers published by them.
This response is from David Baulcombe – corresponding author on this paper. I first became aware of the problem when I was informed about the pubpeer entry a few days ago. Since then I have been investigating the problem and I will notify the editor shortly. I recognize that I should have detected the error before the article was submitted and I apologise for the error.

The Editors of JEM have been asked to print the following retraction, which was approved by Dr. Larry Pease and by the Mayo Clinic research integrity officer who oversaw the investigation:
An investigation by the Mayo Clinic has determined that one of the researchers in Dr. Larry Pease's laboratory at the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Suresh Radhakrishnan, tampered with another investigator's experiment with the intent to mislead toward the conclusion that the B7-DCXAb reagent has cell-activating properties. Using blinded protocols, experiments were done to see if published results based on this reagent could be replicated. Specifically, the repeat experiments examined the activation of dendritic cells, activation of cytotoxic T cells, induction of tumor immunity, modulation of allergic responses, breaking tolerance in the RIP-OVA diabetes model, and the reprogramming of Th2 and T regulatory cells. In no case did these repeat studies reveal any evidence that the B7-DCXAb reagent had the previously reported activity. The authors of this paper therefore wish to retract this paper because they were unable to reproduce key aspects of the studies, and hence the published results cannot be considered reliable.",,"['Authorship', 'Data', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Misconduct - Official Investigation/Finding', 'Misconduct by Author', 'Misconduct by Company/Institution', 'Results Not Reproducible']","['Authorship', 'Data', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Ethical Violations by Author', 'Investigation by Company/ Institution', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Investigation by Third Party', 'Misconduct - Official Investigation/Finding', 'Misconduct by Author', 'Misconduct by Company/Institution', 'Misconduct by Third Party', 'Plagiarism of Data']","['Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher']","['Authorship', 'Data', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Breach of Policy by Author', 'Cites Retracted Work', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Contamination of Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Date of Retraction/Other Unknown', 'Duplicate Publication through Error by Journal/ Publisher', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'Ethical Violations by Author', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Hoax Paper', 'Informed/Patient Consent - None/Withdrawn', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Manipulation of Results', 'Miscommunication by Author', 'Miscommunication by Journal/Publisher', 'Misconduct by Author', 'Objections by Author(s)', 'Original Data Not Provided', 'Results Not Reproducible', 'Sabotage of Methods', 'Taken via Peer Review', 'Updated to Correction', 'Updated to Retraction', 'Withdrawn to Publish in Different Journal']",[],[],[],[]

The authors of the above article request that it be retracted from The Plant Cell. Following recent allegations that this article contains a substantial amount of image irregularities, the authors confirm the inappropriate manipulations listed below.
Figure 2:
Open in a new tab
Improper image manipulations occurred on the CHS high and low molecular weight RNA hybridization blots depicted in Figure 2A (the P38 track was duplicated and inverted), Figure 2B (the P38 track was duplicated and inverted), and Figure 2C (the P25 track was duplicated). The rRNA loading controls depicted below the RNA gel blots of Figures 2A and 2B were improperly manipulated (shuffling, duplication, and/or inversion) and are not the correct cognate samples.
Figure 4:
Open in a new tab
The rRNA loading control depicted below Figure 4A (right-hand side; wild-type/P25/P15 samples) does not show the correct samples.
Figure 5:
Open in a new tab
The rRNA loading control depicted below Figure 5A does not show the correct samples.
Figure 6:
Open in a new tab
A white vertical bar should have been displayed between the wild-type (wt) track and the P25/P15 tracks for the CUC1 (Figure 6B, right-hand side) and the SCL6-IV blots (Figure 6C, top panel, right-hand side) to indicate splicing of the single blot from which all the samples displayed on this figure (wild type, P19, HC, P38, P25, and P15) originated. In addition, for the ARF10 blot displayed on the right-hand side of Figure 6C (bottom panel), an error occurred during splicing of the blot. The wild-type track depicted for the P25/P15 part of the figure should be the same as the one depicted on the left-hand side blot (for P19/HC/P38).
Figure 7:
Open in a new tab
Improper image manipulations occurred on the low molecular weight RNA hybridization blots corresponding to miR163 (Figure 7C, right-hand side, the P25 track was duplicated), small RNA 96 (Figure 7D, the P38 track was duplicated) and AtSN1 (Figure 7E, the HC/P38 tracks were duplicated). The rRNA loading controls depicted below the low molecular weight RNA gel blots displayed in Figures 7B to 7F were improperly manipulated (shuffling, duplication, and/or inversion) and are not the correct samples.
The authors wish to issue the following statement: Given the number and nature of these irregularities, we believe that the most appropriate course is to issue a full retraction of this publication. We wish to state that the first author, Patrice Dunoyer, was solely involved in generating the erroneous figure panels. The corresponding author Olivier Voinnet takes full responsibility for the publication of this erroneous article and deeply apologizes for the inconvenience caused.","#62
Readers who come to PubPeer link to many articles, for many reasons. That means that a background update, on this first anniversary of the Voinnet responses at PubPeer, seems to be extremely fitting, if not necessary. The Voinnet saga is at a crossroads deserving greater public exposure. In 2 days from now, all Voinnet paper-related comments will be pushed off the top page of PubPeer, only to be forgotten into the archives of scientific inquiry. How can raising awareness about Voinnet on Voinnet-related articles be considered spam? Just because you made the first comment on PubPeer doesn't mean that you can claim ownership to the public importance and the need for the public to be updated.

Since I am Peer 1, it will be clear that I posted the first (and, as it happens, also the second) set of problems identified in this paper. This means I know the issues with the paper as well as anybody.
But what is the matter with you Peer 16? You have just posted the same comment to over 40 papers here. How exactly is that in the interests of PubPeer and its readers? In my opinion you have done us a great disservice.
There were some quite interesting discussions in the top of the PubPeer recents. The CRISPR article surely amongst the most interesting for a very broad set of scientists. But now, thanks to you, all active discussions have been suppressed by your obsession with what is essentially yesterday's news. Why can't you see that this is spam pure and simple? Whatever goal you think you are achieving, you have probably just done the opposite.

In Figure 6 the WT RNA loading controls are also duplicated (lanes 1 and 5, top row of images) and lanes 1 and 5 (middle row of images - the corresponding blots for these loading controls were previously shown to be duplications by Peer 4). The Plant Cell retraction does not indicate that this figure also had loading control manipulations.

"" The committee found manipulation of figures in thirteen articles, in which Mr. V is the author ; furthermore Mr V acknowledged having made some of the offending figures and assumed responsibility for all thirteen Articles implicated by the inquiry""
What is most upsetting is that the ETH commission only examined the gel images flagged in pubpeer. Are we thus to assume that all of the other figures and values reported in all of these papers are accurately reported? Its much easier to change a line, a data point, or error bars to make a figure more ""beautiful"".

I think the message to young scientists is clear - photoshop your way up and apologize later.
just don't get caught too soon and you'll be fine.

""independent commission of inquiry""
Why can the identities of the members that composed this committee not be released publicly? The plant science community needs to freely and independently judge whether the commission members were free of COIs and/or associations with Voinnet and with any of his multiple authors across several continents, and their research institutes.
Seeing that Voinnet seems to be staying on at ETH Zurich, it seems appropriate to request him to address the plant science community in an open letter and also explain how the remaining 25+ papers with queries that have not yet been corrected will be addressed.
#51
I am contemplating leaving science. A very inadequate verdict and a devastating message to all ""real"" young (as well as old) scientists out there. Another option would be to change one's rigorous scientific approach completely and instead do as a great researcher just tweeted regarding this ETHZ-report: ""Please note that from now on my favorite wild type root meristem confocal image will be recycled as a control in all publications to come ;)""

Great response by the Institute. I believe the conclusions and actions are adequate.

Indeed, it would be interesting to know if Patrice Dunoyer freely admitted to being solely responsible. The wording of the retraction does not really make that clear.
The official statement* made by ETZ Zurich in early April is extremely worrisome: ""the studies’ findings are not in doubt"". There is now valid concern about all of Voinnet's papers and about the affiliations he and his authors are and have been associated with. This case is the de facto ""black swan"" of plant science.
* https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2015/04/allegations-under-investigation.html
According to Dr. Vance (above) the labeling of the control for figure 2 changed each time the manuscript was submitted to a new journal. Was this all Patrice Dunoyer's doing?
Seems to me like Dunoyer is being thrown under the bus...
#44
Notice carefully how The Plant Cell fails to address any of Vicky Vance's statements, and how it assumes zero responsibility for a failed peer review and for not having acted upon advice offered at that time. This case reveals that there is great merit in releasing peer review reports. The case is astonishing because we are dealing with the world's No. 1 plant science journal (in terms of IF).
Paper is now officially retracted with Patrice Dunyoer taking all the blame for manipulations. http://www.plantcell.org/content/early/2015/06/02/tpc.15.00407.full.pdf

In reply to the person who left the comment relating to one of V. Vance's papers:
""Would you be also able to share with us the splicing procedure in Fig.5 of http://www.plantcell.org/content/17/11/2873.full.pdf+html
miR164*, miR167* and miR172 are not vertically spliced as apposed to miR162, miR164, miR167, EtBr panels that are vertically spiced.""
That's easy! The RNA blot panels are autoradiographs, so each group of three tracks will have been exposed for an appropriate time for that probe/blot combination. The original blot was probably cut up with scissors so that each group of three bands could be left for just the right time with an x-ray film. You have to leave these to expose from minutes to a couple of weeks, depending on the strength of the signal. By contrast, the loading controls are a direct photo, taken under UV light, of a part of the original gel, after staining in ethidium bromide (EtBr). You wouldn't usually stain a whole such gel as EtBr tends to mess up subsequent hybridisation signals. In short, the fact that vertical lines appear between some of the autorad panels and not within the EtBr-stained strip is quite normal as a range of different exposures may have been given to the former. This means that hybridisation band intensities are only directly comparable within each group of three bands. I don't think there is any issue with this Figure.

It is not hard to understand. However, how can you be satisfied with the current process is beyond me, given that:
1. The authors had the opportunity to supply the original data and respond to queries on pubpeer prior to the initiation of any investigation. They refused to do so for any of the multitude of papers challenged. I think that speaks for itself.
2. The allegations arising from Dr. Vance review are as much against the Plant Cell editors as they are against OV. The journal owes a response to these serious allegations, but have quiet so far. They should not be concerned with the possible investigation of OV. It is a separate case.
3. The wording of the ETH press release is annoyingly vague. when was the commission set up? in January, when reports came out, or just recently, when it got to the press?
The praising of Vionnet is also weird - if they know a priori that the finding of the studies are not in doubt (a false claim!), what is there to investigate?
this feels more like a coverup than an honest investigation. How can you not understand this?
I honestly doubt that without constant pressure and close follow up of the community, we will see real justice.
While I cannot answer for Dr. Vance, I have been an editor of major scientific journals for almost 20 years and have handled at least 1000 manuscripts. During that time, I have had reviewers question whether figures were manipulated, but I have never had a reviewer ask to see the original data. I, on the other hand, have certainly asked authors to supply original data as the editor, in response to reviews with these types of questions. It is the duty of the editor and the journal to determine if there is any validity to claims. Dr. Vance did precisely the right thing. She laid out very clearly what the issues were, why she thought that there were problems and went so far as to give detailed information about where she could be reached for further contact. The journal CHOSE to accept another version of the manuscript and not contact Dr. Vance. She has zero fault here. I cannot say the same for the editor of this paper and The Plant Cell.
#37
@Peer 1.
I think you illustrate perfectly the current conflation of two important issues that should be independent.
The first is the data supporting the publications that have been questioned. The second is who might be responsible for any tweaking that might have happened. For sure, apportioning of blame and fault, if any, should be done carefully and why not in secret. However, even if the data are likely to be an important part of any proceedings, there is no reason for the data to be kept secret. Scientists trying to build on this work should be able to evaluate its worth for themselves, now.
Thank you Prof. Vance for posting your detailed referee’s report for this paper. Yet, since you studied the manuscript so carefully, Peer 1 is puzzled as to why you did not ask for the original gels? It seems quite standard that the journals I have refereed for have always offered referees the option to request original data. As the diagramming posted above has indicated, the duplications rather rule out that these would have existed. Maybe if the originals had been confronted way back when, we would not need to be here now?
While I am posting, perhaps I can remind the rubberneckers thirsting for ever more salacious titillation to allow due process to take place
https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2015/04/allegations-under-investigation.html
Like it or not (and I for one do), there is such a thing as employment law in the affected European countries. If the institutes do not investigate serious allegations in *total* confidentiality, they will be legally liable. This also means that publishers have to respect the confidentiality that they promised during the handling of manuscripts. It also means that all coauthors (at least in the three affected countries) will have been issued with instructions not to respond to media queries until after the reports are published. Why is this so hard to understand?
Thank you Dr. Vance. The fact the TPC ignored this is nothing short of outrageous and the community should demand a real explanation from the journal.
This is so sad. How ugly can this story get?
Wow. Why was this devastating review dismissed? I really want to see the detailed Response to Reviewers that Voinnet wrote. Maybe he will post it. Had to be quite a story to get Plant Cell to publish this paper. The review does make one wonder what is in all the other papers beyond the gels that are simple to evaluate.
Vicky Vance has released her peer reviewer report for Dunoyer et al, 2004: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274637686_This_is_my_review_of_the_Voinnet_2004_Plant_Cell_paper_downloaded_from_the_journal%27s_website._The_review_is_from_November_2003

Regarding one of the concerns pointed out by Vicky Vance, you can get Hc-Pro homozygous lines. I do have them. You just need to grow the plants at 16 degrees that they can set seeds...

I think it is pretty clear why they did that. It is quite sad, but clear. Hopefully now, that people realize these things can be brought to light, editors will be more cautious.

Why didn't the journal send Voinnet's ""detailed response"" back to Dr. Vance for comment? If I was the editor, I would have. Instead they ignored her and believed him.
#28
""The corresponding author, Dr. Olivier Voinnet, provided a detailed
response to the reviewer’s allegations which, at the time, satisfied both the Editor-in-Chief and
the Co-Editor"". I would love to read that explanation. It's good it's being retracted, but the journal takes no responsibility.
This paper is about to be retracted: http://my.aspb.org/news/225260/The-Plant-Cell-Statement-Regarding-Review-of-Voinnet-Manuscript-by-Dunoyer-et-al.-2004.htm

Peer 6, wrong, at least journals were informed for sure. Plant Cell and EMBO J were informed by Dr. Vance about suspicions of manipulations through the confidential referee reports (it is beside the point now should you still not believe this). Nevertheless, Plant Cell published the paper and EMBO awarded Dr. Voinnet a Gold Medal some years after.
#9
Dr. Voinnet is not the only author on the paper. The first author can also provide any evidence that invalidates the claims made. He did leave a single (vague) comment three months ago.
I commend Dr. Vance for publicly providing this information, and I disagree that this should be done in a secretive way. We have too many secrets and backroom deals as it is. It also has the value of encouraging other people with similar experiences to come forth.
I also agree with peer 7. Dr. Vance was in the rare position of having seen three versions of the same manuscript. Most reviewers if they get a second version of a paper to review are upset if the author didn't make changes requested by the reviewer. If Dr. Vance is correct, it appears here that the author did make changes to the writing, methods and figures, but without apparently conducting new experiments. This is certainly one of the most serious allegations that I have heard in my career. Plant Cell archives copies of all reviews on their website and I have no doubt that Dr. Vance has a copy of her original review as does the journal. The individuals who dealt with this manuscript 11 years ago are likely not in the same positions today. These individuals however, will have to answer for how this particular manuscript was published so quickly following what must have been a very alarming review.
#9
Peer 6, how do we know the journals and institutions were not already and repeatedly informed, but failed to react? After 10 years, we should assume they were told at some point, shouldn't we?
Then, in which way is Prof Voinnet prevented from replying? I have difficulties to believe that ETH or CNRS hinder his releasing of ready evidence which would clear his name and put all critics to shame.
#9
""P.S. Regarding the first questions, spelling her name is much easier than spelling his name. I am a lazy person""
Fair enough!
Also, regarding Unregistered's comment about Plant Cell leaking reviewer names: it might not have been a leak. It's sometimes possible to work out who reviewers are from a) the way they write and b) what they write about. i note that Voinnet and Vance co-authored a paper before this (2002, iirc), so it's likely that Voinnet would know roughly how Vance wrote and what was going on in her lab. So, a) if he'd suggeted her as a reviewer, b) if he knew what her writing style was like, and c) if (for example) he knew that her lab had been trying to get homozgyous lines, but had failed, and then saw a reviewer query the ease with which that could be done, then it wouldn't take much of a guess to put all those together.
I've certainly seen (at conferences) one person ask another whether or not the other was a reviewer (usually in a friendly way, to thank them for a good review, btw). And I've *never* heard of a journal or editor leaking a reviewer's name, because that would be IMHO an instant and automatic resignation issue (cf. journalists going to prison to protect their sources). So, at least in my experience, my immediate assumption (assuming Vance's narrative is generally in good faith) would be that Voinnet worked it out, rather than there being a leak.
I've been wrong before, though.
#9
I think it would have been more appropriate to inform the investigating institutes and the journals again. It is unfair to make accusations against someone who probably cannot write anything back at this stage.
P.S. Regarding the first questions, spelling her name is much easier than spelling his name. I am a lazy person :).
#9
Vicki Vance writes ""as he had somehow found out that I was a reviewer"". Whoever told Olivier Voinnet that has the reviewer has also breached the guidelines. The Plant Cell journal should investigate.
#9
1. Just out of interest, Peer 6, why did you give Prof. Vance's first name, but not Prof. Voinnet's?
2. Prof. Vance's comment is an extraordinarily brave thing to write. I think it's the first time somebody has put their name to a specific allegation concerning Prof. Voinnet?
3. ""I find it of poor taste to use this platform for launching such an attack on Dr. Voinnet"". Two points here:
a) This case is serious enough for 'taste' to be largely irrelevant.
b) The comment *isn't* an attack on Prof. Voinnet. It's simply a description of his perceived behaviour (or of that of someone in his group) in one instance (the paper submission).
Finally, IANAL, but I'm pretty sure Prof. Vance's comment also meets at least one of the three defences against a UK defamation charge (used to be called 'fair comment defence', but I think the name's changed recently). Essentially, it's a comment made:
- about the commenter's interpretation of a particular event
- to an informed group of people (= us)
- who stand to lose if the commenter's interpretation is correct
If Prof. Vance's belief in her interpretation of events is sincerely held, then this is absolutely an appropriate place to make that comment. It doesn't, legally, even need to be correct (although that would be one of the other two defences), just sincerely held and made for our benefit (i.e. a warning to be on our guard), rather than for Prof. Voinnet's discomfiture.
I couldn't agree with peer 7 more. I appreciate that Dr. Vance made this information available and that she was willing to identify herself is crucial. I've been very disappointed by the overall lack of discussion regarding the 'issues' with these papers and the lack of action on the part of the journals involved. As a post-doc, I am very aware of how much this is being watched and discussed by younger researchers....it sends a bad message to future researchers that there have been no consequences (as far as we can tell) for this behaviour. And I agree that nothing has been proven either way, it is possible that all these 'discrepancies' have reasonable explanations. But unless voinnet is willing to step forward and provide original raw data, or even some type of explanation, it is hard to just assume his innocence after reviewing years of questionable blots. Either way, this story needs resolution.
#17
This 2006 paper was handled at PNAS by David Baulcombe, Voinnet's former PhD boss, thus conflicting PNAS' own guidelines for selection of academic editors (thesis supervisors deemed inappropriate) : https://pubpeer.com/publications/17164336
Thus, who were the other referees of this Plant Cell paper? Has there been a COI as well?
Both Plant Physiology and Plant Cell reject papers, if there is JUST 1 experiment suggested by the either of the reviewers. They call this tyranny as ""encouragement to resubmit"", it doesn't even come under revision category. In this case, the reviewer raised a red flag of swapping controls from the other two versions that were submitted to G&D and EMBO J. All one is saying is that if Dr. Vance posts the review of all the three versions of the Plant Cell 2004 paper, Plant Cell would come under an ambit of scrutiny for letting it deliberately slide.
The point is with that serious allegation by Dr. Vance for the Plant Cell review, how Plant Cell accepted the paper in less then 3 weeks after its submission?
#12
We have contacted Dr. Vance and she has confirmed that she left the comment above.
#12
I think the point is that Vicki Vance signed her comment, so the statement is verifiably hers. Whether you believe her is then up to you. However, making such a statement falsely would expose her to immediate legal risk and all other manner of criticism (for bad taste...) and reprisals, so I don't doubt that it was made after careful deliberation.
Unreg and peer 6, if Dr. Vance could release the peer reports she conducted of the three journals, that would be revolutionary. And would be the direct proof of what she states. Even if she cannot provide these reports, there is now pressure on the three journals to cough up these reports, otherwise there will be concerns about the journals as well as Voinnet.
I think in some respect peer6 is correct. From pubpeer's own site

The following is my experience with reviewing this Plant Cell paper from 2004. This was the first paper to come out of Voinnet's lab as an independent investigator. What happened is that his paper was submitted to two different journals before finally ending up at Plant Cell. I reviewed it all three times (I think he must have suggested me as a reviewer). The first time it was submitted to Genes and Development. There were a number of problems with the paper. Among the problems was the control for Figure 2. He had crossed an RNAi line to a bunch of lines expressing different viral suppressors of silencing, so the control should have been the RNAi line crossed to a WT plant, but he had used the homozygous RNAi line as a control. I said that in my review. The paper was rejected at G&D and I got it to review again less than a month later, this time submitted to EMBO J. It was then that I noticed that he now claimed that the control for Figure 2 was the RNAi line crossed to a WT plant (the control I said it should have been in the previous review). However, the northern blot was the exact same blot (I still had the G&D version on my computer and it was exactly the same). So it was clearly a lie. I said as much in my EMBO J. review - I explained the issue to the editor, but also included it in my review to the authors. The paper was rejected, but, as far as I know, EMBO J. did nothing further (though it seems to me that this is a serious thing and I did not make the decision to report it lightly – but, honestly, what else could I do?). When it was submitted to Plant Cell a short time later, I again got it to review. This time Figure 2 was back to the initial version (no longer claiming that the control was the heterozygous RNAi line). In my review, I explained the situation with the previous reviews and the inappropriate changes and said I was conflicted about reviewing the paper, but did write a review. The paper still had issues among which was the report that they had 7 independent homozygous HC-Pro lines. I noted that no other labs had been able to get a homozygous HC-Pro line (we had tried pretty hard) and yet, somehow they had gotten 7 independent ones. I said I didn't believe it. When the Plant Cell paper was published, they now said none of the lines were homozygous. So basically, I don't believe anything from that lab since that time. Perhaps some of the results are true (probably many of them are), but there is no way to tell which ones are just random made-up data to support Voinnet’s view of the world. This is a kind of lie for which there is no physical evidence like that reported by others and I only know of it because of the circumstances of reviewing the paper for three different journals. Finally, I found out some short time later at a conference that Voinnet's lab had been visited by Plant Cell to check for discrepancies in the reported data (this I learned from Olivier himself). He was very angry over this and blamed the problem on me (as he had somehow found out that I was a reviewer). At that conference, he threatened that he would see to it that I was “drummed out of science” because of this incident. I asked him what I was supposed to do - I was simply in the unfortunate position of having caught him lying and I had no choice but to report it. I communicated this experience to many people at the time and over the years since. I will say again now what I have said over the years. There is no place in science for people who lie about science. That’s my experience. I wish it had never happened, but it did. I think a lot of damage has been done to the field and to many innocent people who worked with Voinnet. It’s a shame.

This response is from Olivier Voinnet -corresponding author on this paper. Through an anonymous email, I have become recently aware of a potential problem with this paper describing work conducted under my supervision. Since then, I have been investigating the problem and have notified the editors. My apologies for not having detecting this error before the paper was submitted.

This response is from Patrice Dunoyer. I am the first author on this paper and became aware of potential problems with this paper when I recently received an anonymous email. Since then, I have been actively working to address the issues and the corresponding author, Olivier Voinnet, is currently contacting the journal editor. Our apologies for any inconvenience caused.
Please also check loading control in Figure 5A. I wouldn't be surprised if lane 3 is a mirror image of lane 1.
If anything, the controls in Fig. 2 are even more exciting. Plus another three non-control lane duplications. Inversions are indicated by mirror images of the same-coloured shapes.

The “mole” is indeed interesting. The rest of the gel has, for whatever reason, a narrow range on the grey scale. The dark mole, which is not found in the duplicate lane, is outside the grey scale range of the gel, suggesting that it is some sort of cosmetic addition.
Wow! I like the extra ""mole"" on top of the leftmost lane highlighted in the left-hand blue boxes (panel E). Dust on the mouse?

+Concerns/Issues About Image","The authors and editors retract this publication following an investigation into concerns around the data presented in Figures 3 and 4 that were brought to the editors’ attention. The text below has been agreed to by the editors and authors.
Some of the lanes presented in Figure 3 (five out of six lanes of the right ""Ret"" panel in Fig 3B) came from an unrelated experiment that had already been published in Fig 4A of a Biochem J paper from 2003 by the de Franciscis lab, with the same first author (Cerchia et al. Biochemical Journal, 372, 897–903). As this previously published data is subject to copyright, this content has been removed from the published record of this paper. Additionally, several lanes have been duplicated both within Figure 3 and between Figures 3 and 4 of this paper.
Some of the original blots were provided to the editors as part of this investigation and the first author, LC, states that the errors occurred as a consequence of incorrect incorporation of representative blots in the figures and, together with the senior author responsible for oversight of Dr. Cerchia when the research was carried out (VdF), apologizes for this. Even though LC maintains that the conclusions remain valid, the detected image manipulation in the published figures undermines the confidence of the other authors (FD, CP, JB, YA, KG, BT & DL) and the overall editorial confidence in the results presented in the latter half of this study. It should be noted specifically that the co-authors from collaborating groups (FD, CP, JB, YA, KG, BT & DL) were not involved in the preparation of these figures, and there is no concern about the results that they contributed (Figures 1 & 2). The manipulations were not identified prior to publication and all three senior authors (BT, VdF & DL) approved the submitted manuscript.
An institutional inquiry has been undertaken at the CNR in Rome, where de Franciscis and Cerchia are both located; a retraction was deemed appropriate as a result of this inquiry.
Given the serious concerns about the validity of some of the data presented in this paper, the authors and editors are thus issuing a retraction. The authors deeply regret any inconvenience this publication has caused for others. All authors agree to this retraction.

The Hdac2 band is just a hot mess so I have shown it twice, in original form and with contrast enhanced. Vertical discontinuities around lane 1, and between lanes 7-8. Lane 4 appears to be a retouched copy of lane 3. All sorts of stuttering happening in lanes 15-18.

Figure 8C is perhaps best approached band-by-band. Here's the Dnmt3b band. As peer2 noted, lanes 17-18 duplicate lanes 15-16. There is also a vertical glitch between the Input lane and the others.
Dnmt3a band. As peer2 noted, there are two pairs of lane duplications. And what are all those blurry smeary marks in lanes 12 to 15?

17535111,"+Results Not Reproducible
+Doing the Right Thing","Our original paper strongly implicated the photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) in the response of the Drosophila circadian system to temperature. The claim was based on three findings:
CRY formed a complex with the two key clock proteins Period (PER) and Timeless (TIM) not only in response to a light pulse but also in response to a 37°C heat pulse.
A mutant strain missing wild-type CRY did not phase shift in response to a heat pulse, implicating CRY in heat-mediated phase shifts in addition to its well-known importance for light-mediated phase shifts. This mutant phenotype was rescued by expressing wild-type CRY within clock neurons.
The absence of CRY inhibited the per L effect on another temperature-centric feature of rhythms, temperature compensation of circadian period. The period of per L becomes longer at elevated temperatures, whereas it is essentially unaffected in wild-type flies. We reported that a double mutant strain, expressing PERL and also missing wild-type CRY, recovered normal temperature compensation. In other words, CRY was necessary for PERL to affect temperature compensation, consistent with a PER-CRY interaction.
We were contacted some months ago by Mike Young and colleagues at The Rockefeller University, who could not repeat the second finding. We subsequently repeated this experiment ourselves and also observed what Young and colleagues told us, i.e., we could not replicate the original observation that implicated CRY in heat-mediated phase shifts. As we no longer had the double mutant strain necessary to repeat the third finding (restoration of proper temperature compensation in a double mutant strain containing the mutant perL chromosome and missing wild-type CRY), we constructed a very similar strain and assayed these per L; cry 0 flies for temperature compensation. It was aberrant, essentially indistinguishable from single mutant per L flies. We have therefore failed to reproduce two of the three findings in the original paper.
Although we have absolutely no explanation for the discrepancies with the original results and despite the lack of an attempt to reproduce the first finding (the heat-mediated formation of a CRY-PER-TIM interaction), the failure to reproduce two of the three findings in the original paper compels us to retract the paper. We deeply regret any inconvenience that this has caused the scientific community.

The editors of The Journal of Cell Biology have been notified by Dr. Daniel St Johnston and Dr. Jay E. Brenman that they and the other authors of the paper referenced above retract the paper. As a result of this retraction, no data in this paper should be cited in the scientific literature.
The authors state:
Although the identification of lethal point mutations in the Drosophila ampkα gene and the originally identified neuronal phenotype (Fig. 1) remain valid, in follow-up experiments we have discovered that the defects in polarity marker localization, in actin distribution, and in epithelial integrity reported for lkb1 and ampk mutant clones in the ovary follicular epithelium under starvation conditions (Fig. 2, A–C, and Fig. 4) result from an artefact. In short, follicular cell clones that should contain GFP can become damaged and create “false clones” of GFP-negative cells with the above-described defects. Bona fide lkb1 and ampk mutant clones marked using a different technique do not show these phenotypes. As a result, our previous conclusion that LKB1 and AMPK function are required to maintain epithelial polarity and epithelial integrity under conditions of energetic stress is incorrect. Our conclusion that expression of AMPKα-T184D can rescue these defects in lkb1 mutant clones (Fig. 5) therefore also is incorrect. We have further described this damage-induced artefact in a separate publication (Haack et al., 2013).
Not affected by this artefact are the following results reported in Mirouse et al. (2007): the identification and neuronal characterization of ampkα mutant alleles (Fig. 1); the absence of polarity defects in tend mutant clones (Fig. 2 D) and in ampkα3 mutant clones from flies grown on a glucose-only diet (Fig. 2 E); the localization of Cherry-AMPKα and GFP-LKB1 in wild-type follicle cells (Fig. 3 A); and the characterization of the anti-PhosphoT184-AMPKα antibody and its use to localize activated AMPKα in wild-type cells (Fig. 3 B). The ampkα transgenic Drosophila animals and ampkα alleles generated in the study remain suitable for use, and their description is now presented in a separate publication (Swick et al, 2013).
We apologize for any inconveniences that these erroneous conclusions may have caused.

It has come to the attention of the journal, that a review article published last year (Postma et al. 2008) contains several passages which are identical to text published by other authors (Giembycz et al. 2008) without giving reference to the original source of these text blocks. The journal has come to the conclusion that this constitutes plagiarism and hence has decided to retract the paper.

It has come to our attention that multiple HMGA1 bands in the immunoblot images of Figure 1, A, B, and D, and Figure 3D have been inappropriately duplicated. In addition, the p53 blots in Figure 1, A and B, appear to represent a darker exposure of the same blot. The authors are unable to provide the original source files that were used to generate these data. While the authors maintain that these findings were confirmed in replicate experiments, the JCI Editorial Board has decided to retract this paper due to the evident manipulation in these figure panels. No issues have been raised in regard to any of the other data in this manuscript.

In the course of investigating suspicious patterns of experimental results in the laboratory, a systematic and in-depth study of key findings in this article was carried out using blinded protocols. In these repeat studies, no evidence was found to support our original conclusions that B7-DC XAb modulates dendritic cell functions. We do not believe our failure to reproduce our earlier findings is the result of a technical problem. A member of the B7-DC XAb investigative team, Dr. Suresh Radhakrishnan, who was involved in or had access to all the work on this subject, was found in a formal investigation to have engaged in scientific misconduct in unpublished experiments involving the B7-DC XAb reagent. This finding of misconduct and our inability to reproduce key findings using blinded protocols has undermined our confidence in our published reports. We seek, therefore, to retract this body of work.

Lemus, one of the authors of this article. The investigation has questioned the validity of the laboratory analyses conducted by Dr. Lemus; concerns were also raised about the existence of co-author Javier Grande.
Given the ephemeral nature of the material used (fresh plasma, swabs and tissues), we are unable to repeat these analyses with the same samples in order to verify the presence of veterinary drugs and pathogens.

+Concerns/Issues About Image
+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figs 1 and 7. Specifically,
There appear to be horizontal and vertical irregularities suggestive of splice lines in the following panels:
○ Between lanes between lanes 4–5 of the Fig 1A left and right FLNA panels, right MOR panel, and left and right Gα panels.
○ Between the 92.3kDa and the 50.4kDa marker of the Fig 1A left MOR panel.
○ Between lanes 2–3 of the Fig 7A Morphine + NLX +FLNA2550-2560 panel.
○ Around multiple bands presented in the Fig 7A MOR and Gα panels
In Fig 1C, neither the published panels nor the underlying data provided in follow-up discussions include a positive control sample. The absence of a positive control calls into question the reliability of the results presented in Fig 1C.
The Fig 7A NLX and FLNA2550-2560 panels appear similar.
The corresponding author noted that the Fig 7A NLX and FLNA2550-2560 panels were inadvertently duplicated and provided a replacement panel for the FLNA2550-2560 panel. However, the corresponding author disagreed with the Fig 1A concerns, stating that the observations are likely the result of image compression artifacts.
The corresponding author provided image data to support the contested western blot results in this [1] and other PLOS ONE articles [2–5]. Per PLOS’ assessment of the data files, the pixel patterns in background areas of blot images provided for multiple panels in [1–5] appear more similar than would be expected for data obtained in independent experiments. Furthermore, the supporting data files did not contain positive controls as needed to verify the reliability of the results. In response to these concerns, the corresponding author stated that the repetitive features in the background noise of the image data are likely the result of scanner artifacts. The explanation given for the background image similarities does not resolve the journal’s concerns in light of PLOS’ assessment of the data files.
The data and comments provided did not resolve the concerns about the integrity and reliability of data presented in this article. In light of these issues, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
HYW and LB did not agree with the retraction. MF either did not respond directly or could not be reached. HYW stands by the article’s findings.

There appear to be horizontal and vertical irregularities suggestive of splice lines in the following panels: ○ Between lanes between lanes 4–5 of the Fig 1A left and right FLNA panels, right MOR panel, and left and right Gα panels. ○ Between the 92.3kDa and the 50.4kDa marker of the Fig 1A left MOR panel. ○ Between lanes 2–3 of the Fig 7A Morphine + NLX +FLNA2550-2560 panel. ○ Around multiple bands presented in the Fig 7A MOR and Gα panels In Fig 1C, neither the published panels nor the underlying data provided in follow-up discussions include a positive control sample. The absence of a positive control calls into question the reliability of the results presented in Fig 1C. The Fig 7A NLX and FLNA2550-2560 panels appear similar. The corresponding author noted that the Fig 7A NLX and FLNA2550-2560 panels were inadvertently duplicated and provided a replacement panel for the FLNA2550-2560 panel. However, the corresponding author disagreed with the Fig 1A concerns, stating that the observations are likely the result of image compression artifacts.
The corresponding author provided image data to support the contested western blot results in this [1] and other PLOS ONE articles [2–5]. Per PLOS’ assessment of the data files, the pixel patterns in background areas of blot images provided for multiple panels in [1–5] appear more similar than would be expected for data obtained in independent experiments. Furthermore, the supporting data files did not contain positive controls as needed to verify the reliability of the results. In response to these concerns, the corresponding author stated that the repetitive features in the background noise of the image data are likely the result of scanner artifacts. The explanation given for the background image similarities does not resolve the journal’s concerns in light of PLOS’ assessment of the data files.
The data and comments provided did not resolve the concerns about the integrity and reliability of data presented in this article. In light of these issues, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
HYW and LB did not agree with the retraction. MF either did not respond directly or could not be reached. HYW stands by the article’s findings. (sic)""

The arguments made by the Cassava supporters are illuminating.
They concern only the possible motivations of some of the actors. It would hardly be surprising for competitors to be amongst those most closely scrutinizing Cassava's scientific basis. And if you discover a problem, what then should you do? The boilerplate quote from the SEC filing (point 4) is astonishingly weak. Anyway, the implicit suggestion that the success of somebody's IPO would depend on Cassava being made less attractive for investment is also weak. I'm sure a LOT of investment would be available for any plausible treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, casting doubt on the field might even have a negative effect on any IPO.
More importantly, the arguments do not address any scientific substance.

Blue arrows: Some sharp background transitions around bands, suggestive of splicing or patching.
Could the authors show us the original uncropped blots? The resolution shown in the paper is not very high, and maybe some of these artifacts might be caused by compression issues. Showing the original blots might take away any concerns.
As noted by Dr Elizabeth Bik in her comment, she looked into these 13 year old images after she was carbon-copied by Travis Whitfill on Twitter.
Though Dr Elizabeth Bik's observations may be factual and unbiased, it may be useful to note the following:
1. The tweet that Travis Whitfill was bringing to the attention of Dr Elizabeth Bik was a link to a Citizen's Petition filed by Labaton Sucharow on August 23, 2021, the petition asks that the drug trials of Cassava Science's experimental drug be paused in order to perform a thorough audit.

4. Four days before (i.e. 8/20/2021) Travis Whitfill asked Dr. Bik about these 13 year old images, Cognition Therapeutics described the following risk in an SEC filing:
""We face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological and scientific change, and there is a possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are safer, more advanced or more effective than ours, which may negatively impact our ability to successfully market or commercialize any product candidates we may develop and ultimately harm our financial condition.""

In the course of investigating suspicious patterns of experimental results in the laboratory, a systematic and in-depth study of key findings in this article was carried out using blinded protocols. In these repeat studies, no evidence was found to support our original conclusions that B7-DC XAb modulates dendritic cell functions. We do not believe our failure to reproduce our earlier findings is the result of a technical problem. A member of the B7-DC XAb investigative team, Dr. Suresh Radhakrishnan, who was involved in or had access to all the work on this subject, was found in a formal investigation to have engaged in scientific misconduct in unpublished experiments involving the B7-DC XAb reagent. This finding of misconduct and our inability to reproduce key findings using blinded protocols has undermined our confidence in our published reports. We seek, therefore, to retract this body of work.

The authors wish to note the following: “After a re-examination of key findings underlying the reported conclusions that B7-DCXAb is an immune modulatory reagent, we no longer believe this is the case. Using blinded protocols we re-examined experiments purported to demonstrate the activation of dendritic cells, activation of cytotoxic T cells, induction of tumor immunity, modulation of allergic responses, breaking tolerance in the RIP-OVA diabetes model, and the reprogramming of Th2 and T regulatory cells. Some of these repeated studies were direct attempts to reproduce key findings in the manuscript cited above. In no case did these repeat studies reveal any evidence that the B7-DCXAb reagent had the previously reported activity. In the course of this re-examination, we were able to study all the antibodies used in the various phases of our work spanning the last 10 years. None of these antibodies appears to be active in any of our repeat assays. We do not believe something has happened recently to the reagent changing its potency. Therefore, the authors seek to retract this work.”

Please do correct me if I am wrong but I was hitherto unaware that The Online Journal Club had been set up as a vehicle for unseemly gloating at another’s misfortune?
If the urge to comment proves to be irresistible though, might it not be more appropriate to thank JBC and the Moffitt Cancer Center for their behind the scenes work toward advancing scientific understanding?
The urge being irresistible though, I, for one, take this opportunity to record my gratefulness to JBC and the Moffitt.

+Duplication of Image","After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about similarities between some of the lanes in the western blot images in Figs 1, 2, 4 and 5 and, a region of similarity between two of the microscopy images in Fig 3.
Specifically, the following data appear similar:
Lanes 2 and 3 in the GAP-43 LAN-5 panel in Fig 1B.
Lanes 2 and 3 in the IB:pTyr SH-SY5Y panel in Fig 2B.
Lanes 2 and 3 in the IB:pTyr SK-N-BE panel in Fig 2B.
Lanes 2 and 3 in the IB:pTyr LAN-5 panel in Fig 2B.
Lanes 1 to 3 and lanes 4 to 6 in the IB:TrkB panel in Fig 2C.
The right half of panel I and the left half of panel J in Fig 3.
Lanes 2 and 3 in the pRet LAN-5 panel in Fig 4A.
Lanes 2 and 4 in the Ret SH-SY5Y panel in Fig 4A.
The 72h SH-SY5Y alpha tubulin panel and the 18h SK-N-BE alpha tubulin panel in Fig 5A.
Lanes 2 and 3 in the Ret SK-N-BE panel in Fig 5B.
Lanes 2 and 3 in the Ret LAN-5 panel in Fig 5B.
In editorial follow up on these issues, underlying images from the original panels of concern were provided for Fig 5A. However, the PLOS ONE Editors consider that the underlying image provided for the 72h SH-SY5Y alpha tubulin panel of Fig 5A did not appear to match the blot shown in the published figure.
The corresponding author stated that the remainder of the original data for the western blots presented in this article are no longer available. The corresponding author provided image data from replicate experiments in support of results reported in Figs 1B, 2B, 2C, 3, 4A and 5B, but these did not resolve the concerns about the published figures.
In light of the above issues, which could not be resolved in the absence of the original underlying data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

+Duplication of Data","On the basis of the recommendation of the American Diabetes Association’s Panel on Ethical Scientific Programs (ESP), the American Diabetes Association, the publisher of Diabetes, is issuing this expression of concern to alert readers to questions about the reliability of the data in the above-cited article.
After readers of the journal contacted Diabetes about potentially duplicated images in the article, the ESP reviewed the following issues:
Lanes 5–8 of the Total Akt strip in Fig. 2G and the IB:IKKβ strip in Fig. 3B appear to be duplicates, and these images appear to have been previously published in the IB: Foxo1 strip of Fig. 5A in the following paper:
Ropelle et al. J Physiol 2009;587:2341–2351. DOI: 10.1113/jphysiol.2009.170050. PMID: 19332486
Bands 3–8 in the Total Akt strip in Fig. 2I appear to have been later republished, with horizontal rotation, as the IB:Tub strip in Fig. 1B (LH) in the following paper:
Prada et al. Diabetes 2013;62:137–148. DOI: 10.2337/db11-1388. PMID 22966070
Lanes 2 and 3 of the IP:EGFR strip in Fig. 5D appear to be duplicates of lanes 2 and 3 of the IB:Caveolin strip in Fig. 5E.
The Panel has contacted the corresponding author to inform him of these concerns, and the corresponding author’s institution, the University of Campinas (São Paulo, Brazil), has been asked to undertake an investigation of these issues. Diabetes will make a final decision on the publication status of this article after the journal obtains more information on the reliability of the data and conclusions presented in the article.
Diabetes is a member journal of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) (publicationethics.org). As such, the editors of the journal and the ESP refer to COPE’s guidelines and recommendations when reviewing such matters.","Retraction:

Our study reported that miR-31 is a regulator of multiple mRNAs important for different aspects of breast cancer metastasis. We recently identified concerns with several figure panels in which original data were compiled from different replicate experiments in order to assemble the presented figure. The scope of the figure preparation issues includes compiling data from independent experiments to present them as one internally controlled experiment, statistical analyses based on technical replicates that are not reflective of the biological replicates, and comparisons of selectively chosen data points from multiple experiments. As many of the published figures are therefore not appropriate or accurate representations of the original data, we believe that the responsible course of action is to retract the paper. We apologize for any inconvenience we have caused.","Retraction Notice.

Thank you very much Dr. Moraes. Is it this SOD2 blot you mentioned?
#6
Thanks Carlos! It is always nice to see an author that reply so rapidly and honestly.
There is also another blot (SOD2) in the Noe et al paper that was copied from the PNAS paper. These are clearly not innocent mistakes, but I cannot discuss it further at this point because it is under investigation. Carlos Moraes
The correction needs correction:
The correction has been published in PNAS:
Correction for Wenz et al., Increased muscle PGC-1{alpha} expression protects from sarcopenia and metabolic disease during aging PNAS 2014 ; published ahead of print October 15, 2014, doi:10.1073/pnas.1419095111
Correction for Wenz et al., Increased muscle PGC-1{alpha} expression protects from sarcopenia and metabolic disease during aging 10.1073/pnas.1419095111
Thank you Peer 1 for pointing out this error. I have contacted the first author who prepared the figures, a postdoc in my lab at the time (2008), and looked into the reasons for the duplication of the the same alpha-tubulin blot in two different figures. She stated that it was a mix-up during figures composition and was able to identify the correct alpha-tubulin blot for figure 4D in the lab data. Accordingly, I contacted the PNAS Editors and requested an ""erratum"" publication. This process is ongoing, and I will update the post with the reference for the erratum, when published. My apologies for the error. Carlos T. Moraes
They are identical.
Compare Figure 4D alpha-tub panel to the alpha-tubulin panel of figure 5D. For a better look at the similarity, vertically stretch Fig 4D . The times and genotypes are different for the individual western blots. See links to the images below....

20414198,"+Manipulation of Images
+Duplication of Image","The above article from The EMBO Journal, published online on 22 April 2010, has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal Chief Editor and Head of Scientific Publications, EMBO, Bernd Pulverer, and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. The authors’ and editors’ statements are as follows.
Authors’ statement
Following an investigation conducted by the The EMBO Journal, the corresponding authors were alerted of several image irregularities found in this paper. Patrice Dunoyer, who assembled the figures, acknowledges making the following errors during their preparation and that the other co-authors were unaware of them:
Figure 3C (@GFP blot): Incorrect splicing of the blot led to a duplicated band improperly used for the final figure. Two dividers should have been also added to clearly indicate splicing of the original blot.
Figure 3C (@IR71 blot): Background duplication was done during image editing instead of putting a divider between the dcl234 samples and the col0 samples to indicate splicing of the original blot.
Figure 4A (@2039 blot): The blot shown in the right-hand side panel of the figure (col0, O. pumila,C. rubella samples) is a duplication of the @2039 signal of the three-first samples of the middle panel. In addition, duplicated sections in the middle panel @2039 were used to cover background noise. The first two and the last two lanes of the loading control (4A, middle panel) are duplicated and mirrored.
Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure S3: The rRNA loading controls displayed are not the cognate ones. Detection of miR159, whose accumulation is unaltered by the mutations shown in Supplementary Figure S3, provides an internal control for equal loading in these experiments.
All authors consider that the core conclusions of the published paper remain valid; graft transmission of endogenous siRNAs has been confirmed in several independent studies. However, the authors admit that integrity of the scientific literature is compromised by the data manipulation and are therefore requesting the article to be retracted.
Olivier Voinnet and Patrice Dunoyer take full responsibility for having allowed the publication of this flawed article. All authors concur with this statement and wish to apologize for the inconvenience caused.
Editors’ statement
The authors provided to the journal images of source data to explain the majority of the serious image manipulations apparent in Figures 3C (GFP and IR71), 4A and 4D and Supplementary Figure S3.
We alert readers to the fact that a number of related papers are also subject to a corrigendum or to a retraction. At The EMBO Journal, these encompass the following:

Peer 3, you are right to praise EMBO J. I truly wish all journals would follow their lead and publish all reviews and responses.
In the case of this paper, the comments from Reviewer #1 are notable for their extreme brevity; they consist solely of 3 short sentences, which makes one wonder if they are the product of a thorough reading or only a quick and superficial skim.
Separately, see the following similarities between differently labelled bands in Fig S3:
#3
""which will allow the journals to ignore the issue.""
That is unfair to the EMBO J which has worked hard on transparency in recent years. Peer review tracks are available on-line and they request authors to provide original data in the supplements.
You might like to ensure that Unreg's new observation is passed on to the journal, otherwise your snide remarks have nothing but nuisance value when looking back from a future standpoint.
#3
many thanks, I am completely useless at spotting such things!
I have originally ridiculed the journal by suggesting it will probably ignore the issue, but after considering the comment by Peer 3 I removed that part, as it would have been unfair to EMBO J. Actually, I only came back to this thread now and forgot that this is about EMBO J, which has generally a much better behaviour than some other, regarding literature corrections and transparency. So there is good hope for proper actions to happen eventually at EMBO J. On the other hand, there are examples of bad editorial handling, like the previous Voinnet corrections in G&D, PNAS and PLOS Genetics (the last one was actually most disappointing, OA, not part of old system at all).
#3
It seems that the @2039 panels contain a variety of repeating patterns, in addition to cut/splices. Illustrated below, and juxtaposed to the inverted panel from Peer 1:
More in figure 4A. The Col-0 bands for @2039 are the same in the central and right panels, although the signals with other probes are different. This can be seen in the inverted panel from Peer 1.

α-JAK2 blot in Fig 2G, α-STAT3 blot in Fig 2H, and panels in other publications.
α-AMPK blot in Fig 5B and panels in other articles.
α-ACC blot in Fig 5C, α-4EBP1 blot in Fig 6F, and a panel in another published article.
The authors offered to repeat the experiments, but they were not able to provide the original, uncropped Western blots used to generate the PLOS ONE figures.
In light of the concerns about image duplication and data non-availability the PLOS ONE editors retract the article.

+Falsification/Fabrication of Image","This article (1) has been retracted at the request of the editors. Following an institutional review by Wayne State University (Detroit, MI), the primary affiliation for several of the authors, it was determined that the article (1) included multiple instances of data falsification and/or fabrication including data reuse, cutting/pasting, relabeling, inappropriate covering or removal of dots and smudges, overlaying/masking, and data composition. Specifically, the review found multiple instances of inappropriate image manipulation of the PTEN, pAkt, and tropomyosin Western blot bands from the MIAPaCa-E experiments and the PTEN and tropomyosin bands from the MIAPaCa-M experiments in Fig. 3A, and a fabricated composite Western blot of pAKT and PTEN (Fig. 3C) and PTEN (Fig. 3D) constructed from bands taken from multiple sources. As a result of these findings, the institution recommended retraction and, upon internal review, the editors agree with this recommendation.

Fig 1A.
Fig 2D:
#4
Fig 4A is full of surprises. Some bands have more horizontal and vertical discontinuities than a patchwork quilt.
Fig 3b:
#4
The CyclinD1 / U251 is also of interest. There is a change of texture between lanes 2 and 3, as if the two left-hand lanes had been stretched vertically from an initially-narrower slice. Also a hint of a vertical discontinuity between lanes 3 and 4.
#3
Fig 3A is another showcase.
In the CyclinD2 slice, the lower region of the first two lanes displays a different grain texture from the rest of that slice, almost as if a section of image has been stretched vertically and then smeared around a little.
Supporting Figure S3A: Several bands appear to be visible multiple times within the same blot panel. Band are sometimes a bit different and spots appear or disappear but backgrounds are remarkably similar.

2019 retraction. http://www.jbc.org/content/294/37/13830
This article has been withdrawn by the authors. The Journal raised questions that the Akt immunoblot in Fig. 2A was reused in Fig. 5B; lanes 1, 2, and 4 of the actin immunoblot in Fig. 4A are the same; the LKB1 immunoblot in Fig. 7B was reused in Fig. 7D; and lane 2 of the tubulin immunoblot in Fig. 9A was reused in lane 1 for Fig. 9C. The authors were able to locate some of the original data and were able to locate some repeated experiments performed at the time of the original work, which the authors state support the conclusions of the paper. The authors offered to publish amended figures based upon that data and, alternatively, offered to repeat the experiments. However, the Journal declined both offers, a decision with which the authors disagree. Further, the authors state that the results of this paper are confirmed by the results of complementary experiments presented in the article and that some of the principal observations of this article were further confirmed in publications from other laboratories (Soliman, H. et al. (2015) Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 309, H70–H81; Lee, S-H. et al. (2014) Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 306, E332–E343). The authors stand by the conclusions of the paper.

The Ethics Committee of the Spanish Superior Council of Scientific Research (CSIC) has carried out a formal investigation in relation to concerns about potential scientific misconduct by Dr. Lemus, a co-author of this article.
Although the field and statistical procedures, as well as the immune assays, reported in the article are correct, the investigation carried out by the Ethics Committee of CSIC has not been able to clarify in which external laboratories Dr. Lemus conducted the microbiological isolation, which raises concerns regarding the validity of the analyses contributed by Dr. Lemus. During the institutional investigation, concerns were also raised about the existence of co-author Javier Grande.
Due to the ephemeral nature of the material used (bacterial microflora isolated from the cloaca, choana, and nares using microbiological swabs and Amies transport medium), we are unable to repeat the analyses with the same samples employed in the original study. As a result, the authors wish to retract this article.

The Ethics Committee of the Spanish Superior Council of Scientific Research (CSIC) has carried out a formal investigation in relation to concerns about potential scientific misconduct by Jesús A. Lemus, the third author of this article. The investigation has questioned the validity of the laboratory analyses conducted by Dr. Lemus. Although the published field and statistical procedures reported in our article are correct, we have been unable to clarify in which external laboratories Dr Lemus conducted the molecular analyses and which primers he used.
We have now partially replicated the work by submitting blood aliquots of the same samples employed in the original study to two different independent laboratories to assess the validity of the published results on avian polyomavirus (APV) in pied flycatchers. In both cases, replicate samples with different IDs were also submitted as controls.
The first re-analysis (Technoscience, Seville, Spain) used the protocol followed by Tomasek et al. [1] on 40 samples previously scored by Dr Lemus as 27 positive and 13 negative for APV. Only 37% (10 out of 27) of the samples originally scored as positive for APV were also positive in the re-analysis carried out by Technoscience, while the consistency was greater for negative scores (86.5%, 11 out of 13 samples scored negative for APV in the re-analysis).
A second, more extended re-analysis (NBT, Seville, Spain) used the protocol by Johne et al. [2] on 276 of the original samples. In addition, the NBT laboratory ran additional PCRs using their own designed primers for a conserved region of APV. All of these analyses have returned negative scores for APV presence in all samples.
In the light of the lack of consistency in relation to the prevalence of APV between the published results and the re-analyses undertaken, the authors Drs Potti, Blanco and Canal wish to retract this article. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience to the readership of PLOS ONE.

Their in situ hybridization (in figures 4 and 7) has problems too: the tissue has lots of big holes, which indicate a freezing artifact (not blood vessels). moreover, one can only see background rather than distinct cell bodies. This is strange considering that the examined genes (Pomc, npy, ..) are very highly expressed in this region.

20876109,+Error in Materials,"PLANT BIOLOGY Retraction for “Autophosphorylation of Tyr-610 in the receptor kinase BAK1 plays a role in brassinosteroid signaling and basal defense gene expression,” by Man-Ho Oh, Xiaofeng Wang, Xia Wu, Youfu Zhao, Steven D. Clouse, and Steven C. Huber, which appeared in issue 41, October 12, 2010, of Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (107:17827–17832; first published September 27, 2010; 10.1073/pnas.0915064107).
The authors wish to note the following: “We wish to retract the information in this article pertaining to the phenotype of transgenic plants expressing BAK1 (Y610F)-Flag presented in Figs. 2 and 3 and Tables 1 and 2. After publication of this article, we became aware that the transgenic plants described in this manuscript were not correct because of inadvertent errors in genotyping of the plants, and thus the in planta results presented are not valid. However, the results identifying Tyr-610 as an autophosphorylation site (in vitro and in vivo) and all results obtained with recombinant proteins (presented in Figs. 1 and 4) are valid, and conclusions drawn from functional and interaction studies in vitro are correct. The responsibility for this experimental error rests with only two of the authors: the senior author (M.-H.O.), who was a Senior Research Scientist when these studies were conducted with extensive experience in molecular biology and whose primary responsibility was production of the transgenic plants. The other responsible individual is the corresponding author (S.C.H.), who failed to provide adequate oversight for the production of the transgenic plants; as a result, critical checks and balances were not in place. The other authors (X.W., Y.Z., and S.D.C.) are not responsible in any way for this regrettable situation. We are currently producing transgenic plants expressing BAK1 (Y610F)-Flag in the bak1 bak1 / bkk1 bkk1 double null background to redo these experiments and plan to publish the results in the near future. We deeply and sincerely regret any scientific misconceptions that have been caused by the above paper. Because we had no reason to question the transgenic plants at the time of publication, the corresponding author’s laboratory spent more than an additional year studying these plants before the error was discovered. We hope to spare others from doing the same. We apologize to the entire scientific community for the misinformation and any adverse consequences that may have resulted.”","Seems to be more to this story than a genotyping error: http://retractionwatch.com/2016/06/28/genotyping-mistake-costs-lab-two-papers-and-year-of-work/

“We wish to retract the information in this article pertaining to the phenotype of transgenic plants expressing BAK1 (Y610F)-Flag presented in Figs. 2 and 3 and Tables 1 and 2. After publication of this article, we became aware that the transgenic plants described in this manuscript were not correct because of inadvertent errors in genotyping of the plants, and thus the in planta results presented are not valid. However, the results identifying Tyr-610 as an autophosphorylation site (in vitro and in vivo) and all results obtained with recombinant proteins (presented in Figs. 1 and 4) are valid, and conclusions drawn from functional and interaction studies in vitro are correct. The responsibility for this experimental error rests with only two of the authors: the senior author (M.-H.O.), who was a Senior Research Scientist when these studies were conducted with extensive experience in molecular biology and whose primary responsibility was production of the transgenic plants. The other responsible individual is the corresponding author (S.C.H.), who failed to provide adequate oversight for the production of the transgenic plants; as a result, critical checks and balances were not in place. The other authors (X.W., Y.Z., and S.D.C.) are not responsible in any way for this regrettable situation. We are currently producing transgenic plants expressing BAK1 (Y610F)-Flag in the bak1 bak1 / bkk1 bkk1 double null background to redo these experiments and plan to publish the results in the near future. We deeply and sincerely regret any scientific misconceptions that have been caused by the above paper. Because we had no reason to question the transgenic plants at the time of publication, the corresponding author’s laboratory spent more than an additional year studying these plants before the error was discovered. We hope to spare others from doing the same. We apologize to the entire scientific community for the misinformation and any adverse consequences that may have resulted.”","['Data', 'Images', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Text']","['Contamination of Materials', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Error in Data', 'Error in Image', 'Error in Materials', 'Error in Materials (General)', 'Error in Methods', 'Error in Text', 'Sabotage of Materials']","['Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process']","['Error in Materials', 'Error in Materials (General)']","['Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concern/Issues about Article', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results']",['Methods'],['Error in Cell Lines/Tissues'],"['Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concern/Issues about Article', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results']","['Authorship', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Cites Retracted Work', 'Duplicate Publication through Error by Journal/ Publisher', 'Error in Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Miscommunication by Author', 'Results Not Reproducible']"

This article has been withdrawn by the authors except Bin Liang, who could not be reached. The Journal raised questions regarding the following. 1) The P-ACC immunoblot in Fig. 1A was spliced. 2) The PARP immunoblot in Fig. 3D appeared to be a composite. 3) A portion of the actin immunoblot in Fig. 5B was reused as Histone3 in Figs. 7A and 8B. 4) The image in Fig. 6D was reused in Fig. 6F. Regarding Fig. 1A, because this original immunoblot could not be recovered 13 years after its publication, the withdrawing authors cannot determine if the P-ACC immunoblot was spliced. For the other immunoblots in question, the withdrawing authors provided to the Journal the original immunoblots for PARP (Fig. 3D), Histone3 (Figs. 5B, 6C, 7A, and 8B), Fig. 6D, and Fig. 6F along with some original immunoblots of a repeated experiment done at the time of the original work. Further, the withdrawing authors have provided the Journal the original immunoblots, which they state indicate that the reuse of images between Figs. 5B and 7 (A and B) and between Fig. 6D and Fig. 6F was an error. The withdrawing authors offered to publish substitute figures based on the repeated experiments and, alternatively, offered to repeat the experiments. The Journal declined both offers, a decision with which the withdrawing authors respectfully disagree. In addition, the withdrawing authors state that the results of this paper have been confirmed by the results of complementary experiments presented in the article and that the principal observations of this article were further confirmed in the publications from other laboratories (Kilbride, S. M., et al. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 36199–36206; Yan, H., et al. (2012) Int. J. Clin. Exp. Pathol. 5, 770–776; Lee, G. R., et al. (2014) Clin. Exp. Metastasis 31, 897–907; Zhang, R., et al.

The 40S ribosomal panels in Figures 5B (in vitro cells) and 6B (in vivo, crawfish) appear to be identical.
In Figure 6A, a cut appears to be visible between the 4th and the 5th lane.
In Figure 6B, lanes 1/2/3 look very similar to lanes 7/8/9. Note the presence and position of small dots under the second and third lanes.
See my concerns illustrated here:
Concerns about Figures 2, 7, and 8:
Cuts appear to be visible in the 40S ribosomal panels of Figure 7A and 8A.
Lanes 6-11 of the 40S ribosomal panel in Figure 2 look very similar to lanes 7-12 of Figure 7A (in vitro, cells), lanes 7-12 of Figure 8A (in vivo, crawfish), and to the mirror image of lanes 1-6 of Figure 7A, and lanes 1-6 of Figure 8A.

Singh, T. et al. (2011) Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, inhibits melanoma cancer cell migration by reducing the expressions of cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin E(2) and prostaglandin E(2) receptors. Carcinogenesis, 32(1), 86–92.
There are two main concerns. First, the beta actin controls for experimental data displayed in Figures 3E and 5B are identical. However, the experimental treatment for data shown in Figure 3 (increasing concentrations of berberine with or without TPA (Figure 3E) or PGE2 (Figure 5B) are different. Thus, there is an ambiguous identification of the control conditions for both experiments. There are no original data or records available with which to confirm the experimental results. Thus, the conclusions of the paper could not be substantiated by the available data.
Second, Figure 1B of this paper contains a photomicrograph of Hs2894t cells treated with 10 ug/ml of epigallo-catchin-3-gallate, an extract of green tea. This image is identical to Figure 2A of another paper (Singh, T. and S.K. Katiyar, Green tea catechins reduce invasive potential of human melanoma cells by targeting COX-2, PGE2 receptors and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. PLoS One, 2011. 6(10): p. e25224); however, the PLoS One image is of control Hs294t cells receiving 0 uM Berberine. Examination of the two panels at high magnification indicated that the same micrograph was used in each figure but labeled as belonging to different experimental groups. The lack of available original data and records preclude an unambiguous identification of the cell type and the experimental treatment in either paper.
This retraction is based on the unavailability of original data and records, the lack of replicate experiments that validate the published findings, and the ambiguous identification of many of the samples, treatments and controls.","Some concerns about Figure 1B not mentioned in the retraction notice:

2018 retraction notice. https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article/39/5/738/4980573 Carcinogenesis is retracting the following paper following a joint research misconduct investigation by the Birmingham VA Medical Center and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, USA. Singh, T. et al. (2011) Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, inhibits melanoma cancer cell migration by reducing the expressions of cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin E(2) and prostaglandin E(2) receptors. Carcinogenesis, 32(1), 86–92. There are two main concerns. First, the beta actin controls for experimental data displayed in Figures 3E and 5B are identical. However, the experimental treatment for data shown in Figure 3 (increasing concentrations of berberine with or without TPA (Figure 3E) or PGE2 (Figure 5B) are different. Thus, there is an ambiguous identification of the control conditions for both experiments. There are no original data or records available with which to confirm the experimental results. Thus, the conclusions of the paper could not be substantiated by the available data. Second, Figure 1B of this paper contains a photomicrograph of Hs2894t cells treated with 10 ug/ml of epigallo-catchin-3-gallate, an extract of green tea. This image is identical to Figure 2A of another paper (Singh, T. and S.K. Katiyar, Green tea catechins reduce invasive potential of human melanoma cells by targeting COX-2, PGE2 receptors and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. PLoS One, 2011. 6(10): p. e25224); however, the PLoS One image is of control Hs294t cells receiving 0 uM Berberine. Examination of the two panels at high magnification indicated that the same micrograph was used in each figure but labeled as belonging to different experimental groups. The lack of available original data and records preclude an unambiguous identification of the cell type and the experimental treatment in either paper. This retraction is based on the unavailability of original data and records, the lack of replicate experiments that validate the published findings, and the ambiguous identification of many of the samples, treatments and controls.","['Data', 'Images', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Duplication of Data', 'Duplication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Manipulation of Images', 'Original Data Not Provided']","['Data', 'Images', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Duplication of Data', 'Falsification/ Fabrication of Data', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Investigation by Company/ Institution', 'Original Data Not Provided', 'Plagiarism of Data']","['Data', 'Images', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Misconduct by Company/Institution']","['Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Contamination of Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'Results Not Reproducible']","['Data', 'Images', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Misconduct by Company/Institution', 'Notice - Lack of']","['Images', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Cites Retracted Work', 'Date of Retraction/Other Unknown', 'Error in Image', 'Results Not Reproducible', 'Updated to Retraction', 'Withdrawn (out of date)']"

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Dr. Blanco, the first author, and the editors retract this publication.
The Ethics Committee of the Spanish Superior Council of Scientific Research (CSIC) has carried out a formal investigation in relation to concerns about potential scientific misconduct by Jesús A. Lemus, the second author of this article. The investigation has questioned the validity of the laboratory analyses conducted by Dr. Lemus.
Given the ephemeral nature of the material used (liver, bursa of Fabricius, etc.), it is not possible to repeat these analyses with the same samples in order to confirm the presence of veterinary drugs and pathogens.
We sincerely apologize to the readership of PLOS ONE.

21203472,"+Manipulation of Images
+Duplication of Image","The authors and editors retract this publication [1] following concerns raised around the images presented in several figures.
After the publication of this article, concerns were raised to the journal that upon adjustment of brightness, contrast, and/or other image settings, several inconsistencies and lines appear in Figures 2, 4, 5, and 6.
In Figure 2, inconsistencies and lines in the HA blot image suggest this panel may have been generated by splicing multiple image fragments.
In Figure 4B, the 6His-XopD1-760 blot appears to include an additional image overlaying the original blot in the lane for sample #26.
In Figure 4B, the 6His-XopD216-760 blot appears to include several unmarked areas of splicing.
In Figure 5B, there appears to be a potential splice line between the first and second lanes of the GFP blot.
In Figure 5E, in the GFP blot, differences in background patterns/coloring suggest that the image may have been altered in the area above the bands in lanes 3 and 4.
Figure 6D appears to include some unmarked splicing in both HA blots, between lanes 3 and 4 for each.
In Figure 6D, lanes 3 and 4 for the Total Extract GroEL blot appear to be the same.
In addition, it was raised that the Ponceau S stained control gel shown in Figure 6B is highly similar to a Ponceau S panel shown in Figure 2B of another article by this research group [2].
The authors indicated that images were assembled inappropriately during preparation of Figures 4B, 5B, and 5E. They also confirmed that Figure 6B involves a duplication of the Ponceau S-stained control band from their previous article [2]. The authors did not provide comments regarding Figures 2 or 6D, and they noted that original blots and gels for the above-mentioned figures are unavailable.
In light of these concerns, the authors and editors retract this article. The authors apologize to the scientific community for the errors published in this article.
The journal editors notified representatives at INRA and CNRS of this matter, and contacted all co-authors about this retraction. SR made the initial request for retraction; SR, DR, DM, LN, MR agreed with the retraction; JC, IA, CP did not respond.

So say all seven of the contemporary retraction statements. It should be born in mind that most journals do not unilaterally retract but accede to the wishes of the institute/authors. In the context of the four year delay since problems were reported for a swarm of papers from this particular M.D. Anderson lab, it would appear that something has changed recently. And as there is only one journal publishing these retractions, the most obvious explanation would be that Biochem. Pharmacol. has toughened up and exerted some pressure on the institute. Is there any chance that other journals will dare to follow in its wake?
Those who have not been following this story from its inceptions may be unaware that the affected publications emanated from the “Best Cancer Hospital in the World”. Although, according to The Cancer Letter, perhaps it wasn't…

In this paper, we described the directed conversion of skin fibroblasts from unaffected individuals or familial Alzheimer’s disease patients into human induced neuronal cells. We also presented molecular analyses of Alzheimer’s-associated markers in these cells. Dr. Ryousuke Fujita, who was specifically and only responsible for the molecular analyses of Alzheimer’s-associated pathology, has acknowledged inappropriately manipulating image panels and data points, as well as misrepresenting the number of repeats performed, in the experiments presented in Figures 6 and 7 of the paper (and corresponding Figures S5 and S6). We are in the process of repeating these analyses. Given these issues, we believe that the most appropriate course of action is to retract the paper. We deeply regret this circumstance and apologize to the community.","Paper retracted:

Dear Pubpeer users:
The authors would like to thank you for your comments. We approached the Journals with all the concerns raised above.
“We are writing to let you know that we were alerted to an error in Fig. 2 of our article. In order to clarify the issues we have supplied:
1. Original images used to construct the tiff images presented in power-point format of Figure 1 and Figure 2 sent to the Journal in 2011.
2. A copy of lab notes from the experiments showing images of strains that should have been used to construct Figure 1A and Figure 2A and 2C.
3. High quality images for K279a, K279a + AX21, raxH+AX21 and ax21 (p0387Y22A) which were misrepresented in Figure 2.
From reviewing the data, there doesn’t appear to be any issue with the images used in Figure 1A. However, there does appear that incorrect images placed in figures of Figure 2A and Figure 2C. We have provided the original correct images seen in the lab notes (attached to this message).
To strengthen our case if required we can provide repeated experiments shown in subsequent lab notebooks by an independent lab member. We would also like to stress that other groups have verified some of the results presented in the manuscript since its publication. We can point you to these articles or get a statement from the lab that repeated the experiment with the strains if required.
We also have attached the high quality images for K279a, K279a + AX21 and ax21 (p0387Y22A) which were misrepresented in Figure 2. Unfortunately, the first author (Yvonne McCarthy) who carried out the experiments will not support a correction and we therefore would like to provide a statement for retraction of this manuscript. We would very much hope that the Journal would allow us to republish the article correcting these issues.”
Further comments can be directed towards Dr. John Maxwell Dow (m.dow@ucc.ie) whose lab the experiments were carried out in.
I’m wondering if there are some other plates also being reused in Figures 1 and 2? The photos would have been taken with different lighting and the images also need to be rotated as regards the shared features. Grey scale adjustments have been made to emphasise the similarities.

+Duplication of Image","The Editor-in-Chief of Stem Cells and Development officially retracts the article entitled, “Detection, Characterization, and Spontaneous Differentiation In Vitro of Very Small Embryonic-Like Putative Stem Cells in Adult Mammalian Ovary,” by Seema Parte, Deepa Bhartiya, Jyoti Telang, Vinita Daithankar, Vinita Salvi, Kusum Zaveri, and Indira Hinduja (Stem Cells Dev 2011;20(8):1451-1464; doi: 10.1089/scd.2010.0461).
A reported comment on the PubPeer platform suggested that the “images in Figure 6D and Figure 6F appear to overlap but are described differently. The images are oriented differently, have different contrast, and are at a different magnification (red boxes are not the same size). Difficult to understand how these transformations would occur merely as errors during figure assembly,” (PubPeer, 2022).
The Editor-in-Chief of the journal contacted the corresponding author of the paper, Dr. Deepa Bhartiya, requesting a “prompt response and intended course of action” to the questions raised on PubPeer. Dr. Bhartiya responded, indicating that the errors in both figures were “an unintentional human error.”
After a series of communications between Dr. Bhartiya and the Editor-in-Chief of Stem Cells and Development, Dr. Bhartiya claimed full responsibility for the contents of the article and requested that corrections to the paper by removing the incorrect images, as indicated in the email below:
“A discrepancy in two figures (Fig 6D and negative control in Fig 11) was picked up by an Artificial Intelligence based tool and pointed out on Pubpeer. A careful examination shows that indeed there is a mistake but it was inadvertent and simply an oversight and not a deliberate manipulation of any kind. It is the same figure of a neuron turned up side down and pasted at two places. This remained unnoticed by the authors and also was not picked up by the reviewers or the readers [for] over a decade. It is our humble request to all those who have cited our work to be rest assured that the work integrity is intact. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to those directly and indirectly affected by this process. My students worked with great dedication to acquire the data and obtained results to compile into a manuscript. There is no manipulation whatsoever and this unintentional error remained unnoticed by everyone involved with the manuscript preparation and publication. We will try to submit the revised version again with due permissions. We request the editor to allow us to publish an addendum/erratum to take care of the mistake otherwise it is his decision to retract the paper.” [sic]
The Editor of the journal rejected the contention that the manipulation and combining of the same images within the panels purported to represent different experiments could be unintentional, and hence has denied the request to publish an erratum and offered the authors the opportunity to self-retract the article. The authors declined to do so and continued to request a corrigendum. The Editor determined that an editorial retraction was warranted based on the discovery of the discrepancies in the images. Dr. Bhartiya was notified via email of the decision to editorially retract the paper.

In my email to editors of the journal, I included this sentence: “In identifying this concern, I was aided by ImageTwin, an image integrity analytical tool.”

""Wish the AI tools available now were also there when the article underwent review in 2010-2011""
I am puzzled by the assumption that an ""Artificial Intelligence based tool"" was used, when all that is required to see the duplication is to look at Fig 6.

Dr. Bhartiya: I have prepared another illustration of the concerns about potential image manipulation in Figure 11N and 11P as originally published in hopes that this will help you understand the gravity of the concerns.
Outlined in red in panel 1 and panel 2 are features that appear in both images, which seems to suggest that the two images represent overlapping field of view of the same sample rather than rabbit and goat samples as labeled. The areas outlined in red could hypothetically be explained by an during figure assembly.
However, my illustration in panels 3 and 4 below show the problems with this hypothesis. The area outlined in blue represents the full region of hypothetical overlap. After obscuring the interior of the similar regions, one can clearly see that there are substantial differences in the remainder of these images. One does not need an artificial intelligence tool to see these differences.
While this matter does not seem to be highlighted in the retraction notice, I cannot think of an innocuous explanation for the differences shown in panels 3 and 4. Can the authors offer an explanation?
This was one of our most highly cited articles. The mistakes pointed out are unintentional human errors. Wish the AI tools available now were also there when the article underwent review in 2010-2011 and the mistakes could easily have been corrected. The figures were not used to generate quantitative data- it was representative data, and we will surely attempt to republish the article with all changes to take care of concerns raised by Pubpeer - we have multiple images that were already shared with the journal.
We agree with the decision of the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal and thank Pubpeer for pointing out the issues. We agree to retraction the article.

Thank you for responding.
How do the authors account for the different features in the areas outlined in orange in #1 (11N and 11P)? These share some similarities in the areas that appear to overlap, yet there are also differences. To me, this suggests the images have been edited. Is there another explanation?
How do the authors account for the different aspect ratios of these images. They share similar scale bars, yet the magnification seems to differ.

Thank you again for the information provided. Please see attached image of the replace neuronal cell which was recovered from our old records. We apologize for the error which went unnoticed by everone and got noticed by the AI software. We assure that it was not done deliberately and that we too missed the same image and hence the confusion. The unintentional error requires to be corrected and we request all the concerned authorities to give an opportunity to correct the error that was missed since more than a decade. We assure that this is a learning experience and will be more careful and diligent in future. I hope the query is addressed and hoping to find some kind help and constructive guidance. Thank you.
We thank you for the information provided. We apologize and ensure that it was purely human error in selection of correct images due to similar cell type and multiple images were prepared at that time. As you correctly noted and hence it remained unnoticed by everyone so far. Kindly see attached corrected image and original image which were retrieved from our old records and hence the time required to revert back. We had sufficient data and only then we compiled it. It was first manuscript of the author and hence it was a learning experience. The unintentional error requires to be rectified and we request all the concerned authorities to understand this scenario and help us to solve this. We assure that this error does not alter the biology stated but nevertheless can be corrected. I hope the queries are addressed. Hoping to find some kind help and constructive guidance. Thank you.
Some images in Figure 11 seem to overlap, but are described differently. Although some seem to be at slightly different magnification and a rotated relative to one another, of greatest concern is the overlap indicated with the orange boxes. Some of the features visible in one do not appear in the other, suggesting the possibility of post-production editing.
The images in Figure 6D and Figure 6F appear to overlap, but are described differently. The images are oriented differently, have different contrast and are at a different magnification (red boxes are not the same size). Difficult to understand how these transformations would occur merely as errors during figure assembly.

For each experimental condition, Vimentin and Fibronectin immunofluorescence panels in the figure appear to be derived from the same original image. The University of Alabama at Birmingham confirmed that original data and records needed to clarify the experiment presented in these panels are not available.
Following a joint investigation by the Birmingham VA Medical Center and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the institutions requested retraction of this article, as the conclusions could not be supported by available data. In line with the institutions’ investigation and recommendation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article based upon the unavailability of original data and records and the ambiguous identification of samples and treatments.
The authors did not comment on the retraction decision.

○ Fig 6 AIF panel, lane 2, and Fig 8 right OGG1 panel, lanes 1 and 3.

○ Fig 6 Cytochrome-C panel between all lanes.
○ Fig 8 right OGG1 panel, between lanes 1–2, and lanes 3–4.
○ Fig 8 left OGG1 panel, between lanes 1–2, and lanes 3–4.

○ Fig 9B MtTFB1 panel and corresponding β-actin panel, between lanes 2–3.
○ Fig 9B far right β-actin panel between lanes 2–3 and lanes 3–4.
The corresponding author stated that some images were spliced during figure preparation to remove extra lanes and/or replicates. They commented that data files were provided to PLOS in 2014–2015, but the underlying data for the figures of concern are no longer available in the laboratory records. PLOS is unable to access the journal’s 2014 correspondence records for this case. We sincerely regret that this case was not resolved much sooner after the prior correspondence.
The PLOS ONE Editors retract this article. Although we have been unable to review the primary data, the nature and extent of image concerns call into question the integrity of data reporting in the published figures and the reliability of the article’s results and conclusions.
GM, FB, and FPG agreed with the retraction and apologise for the issues with the published article. JFB, ED, and EL did not agree with the retraction. RT, DM, and DA either did not respond directly or could not be reached. ES is deceased.

Concern about Figure 9.
Several cuts appear to be visible between lanes. Examples include the POLRMT panel (top right, Figure 9A), the MtTFA panel in Figure 9B, and three of the four actin panels in Figure 9B.
Figure 9B. All four lanes in the GAPDH panel appear to look very similar to each other (orange arrows). A lane in the MtTFB1 panel appears to have the same distinctive shape.
Two additional notes:
The concerns illustrated in #1 and #2 have been reported to the journal per email in May 2014, but have not been addressed so far.
This article has been cited 43 times, as per Google Scholar.
Concern about Figures 6 and 8.
Figure 6. Several bands are surrounded by rectangular sharp transitions in background signal.
Figure 6. In the AIF panel two lanes look remarkably similar (shown with yellow arrows), while one lane looks similar to two bands in Figure 8 (shown in blue).
Figure 6. In the left panel, all four actin bands look similar to each other (red arrows).
Figure 8. In both the left and right OGG-1 panel, sharp rectangular boxes appear to be visible around the bands.
Figure 8. In the right OGG-1 panel, two lanes look similar to each other and to a lane in Figure 6 (blue arrows)

Journal of Cell Science takes these matters very seriously for the sake of the scientific record. These concerns were relayed to the corresponding author, who responded with an explanation and original data. Following review of these data, we felt unable to resolve this matter, and have contacted the authors’ institution and requested that they conduct further investigation.
Journal of Cell Science is posting this Publisher's Note for information purposes only.

The second and third panels in Fig 5D (Cay10580, 0.1 μM and 1.0 μM panels) are similar. The University of Alabama at Birmingham confirmed that the original data and records needed to clarify the conditions represented in these two panels are not available.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham confirmed that original data and records are not available to clarify the identity of the cells and treatment conditions in the reported experiments. The Carcinogenesis article [2] was retracted in 2018 [3].
Following a joint investigation by the Birmingham VA Medical Center and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the institutions requested retraction of this article, as the conclusions could not be supported by available data. In line with the institutions’ recommendation, PLOS ONE Editors retract this article based upon the unavailability of original data and records and the ambiguous identification of samples and treatments.

The authors wish to note the following: “Recently, the Department of Rheumatology from the Leiden University Medical Centre discovered that this publication is based upon fraudulent data, as the first author manipulated several assays used in the studies presented in this publication. By adding anti-IgE antibodies into the tubes containing citrullinated fibrinogen, it seemed that the activation of basophils resulted from exposure to citrullinated fibrinogen. Likewise, controls and samples were manipulated through transfer of cells from positive controls to other tubes that now also appeared to contain a positive reaction. This behavior was done in the absence of all other investigators who did not have knowledge of these irregularities. After discovery of these events, several experiments were performed with the goal to reproduce the data indicating the presence of IgE anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA). The validity of these data as presented in the manuscript could not be confirmed. For these reasons, the authors wish to retract the paper from the scientific record.
The Leiden University Medical Centre has completed an investigation by an independent investigation committee into the violation of scientific integrity and irregularities in this paper and has concluded that sole responsibility for the irregularities rests with the first author. She has admitted manipulating the data presented in the paper.”

Retraction notice: Hepatitis C virus activates interleukin-1β via caspase-1-inflammasome complex
The Microbiology Society Published: 24 October 2019
The article ‘Hepatitis C virus activates interleukin-1β via caspase-1-inflammasome complex’ which was published in the Journal of General Virology in February 2012 has been retracted. This follows formal findings of research misconduct from the Compliance Counsel at Rosalind Franklin University. The actin immunoblot shown in Fig. 3c was found to have been reused in the following publications to represent the loading control at different experimental conditions: Waris et al. (2005) J. Virol. 79, 1569–1580 [1], Waris and Siddiqui (2005) J. Virol. 79, 9725–9734 [2], Waris et al. (2007) J. Virol. 81, 8122–8130 [3], Nasimuzzaman et al. (2007) J. Virol. 81, 10249–10257 [4], Burdette et al. (2010) J. Gen. Virol. 91, 681–690 [5], Burdette et al. (2012) J. Gen. Virol. 93, 235–246 [6], and McRae et al. (2016) J. Biol. Chem. 291, 3254–3267 [7].
Gulam Waris does not agree that the actin immunoblot was reused in other publications.

+Concerns/Issues About Results
+Concerns/Issues About Data","After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about results reported in Figs 1, 2, and 3.
Specifically:
Concerns were raised about animal ethics considerations for the in vivo infection experiments in light of the weight loss reported in Fig 1. In post-publication discussions, the authors stated that animal health was monitored twice per day during the study and that humane endpoints were applied. However, according to the information provided post-publication, the humane endpoint criteria specified that animals should have been euthanized when weight loss exceeded 15%. Fig 1 reports that animals in groups 1, 2, 6, and 9 met or exceeded this limit by day 2 post-infection. In response to this issue, the corresponding author commented that the animal experiments were performed according to the IACUC protocol and that all scores were submitted to the campus veterinarian.
When levels are adjusted, we did not detect verifiable image content in Fig 2A, 2F, 3b(A), or 3b(F). The authors commented that these control samples did not react with the antibodies and no signal was detected. They provided raw image data which for other panels in the figures aligned with the published results. However, even with background levels and/or brightness adjusted, we did not detect any autofluorescence or background signal on the raw images provided for the panels of concern. Also, the images provided for Fig 3b(A) and Fig 3b(F) each include a white speck that appears the same between the two image files.
Concerns were raised about whether the experiments reported in Figs 2 and 3 included adequate controls. In post-publication discussions, the authors clarified that for the experiments reported in Figs 2 and 3, they performed only one mock-infected control experiment and used it for a control experiment using only one APMV N-specific antibody. I.e., they did not conduct mock-infection control experiments for every APMV (APMV-1 to APMV-9). Furthermore, they did not report ‘no primary antibody’ or preimmune serum control experiments to demonstrate the sensitivity and/or specificity of the APMV-specific antibodies in immunohistochemistry experiments. Western blot experiments to evaluate the hyperimmune sera were described in the Methods section but these data were not shown. In addition, no controls were reported in the article to demonstrate the efficacy of the viral infections.
The authors offered replication data for Figs 2 and 3 that included additional controls. However, given the nature of the above concerns, we do not consider that replication data fully resolve the issues.
In light of the above issues, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
SKS did not agree with retraction. SKK disagreed with retraction and stands by the article’s findings. PLC disagreed with retraction, stands by the article’s findings, and apologized for the issues with the published article. KS andSX either could not be reached or did not respond directly.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results in multiple figures. Specifically,
The β-actin panels in Figs 3D and 4A appear similar despite representing different conditions.
The β-actin panels in Figs 3E and 4B appear similar.
The β-actin panels in Figs 3F and 4C appear similar.
These issues were discussed with the corresponding author and the last author. The corresponding author stated that some of the data underlying the results in this article are no longer available, and they provided files described as the uncropped images underlying some of the panels in the above figures.
The corresponding author acknowledged that the β-actin panel in Fig 4A is incorrect. They provided two different images described as the original blot underlying the correct β-actin panel for Fig 4A, as well as the images described as the underlying blots for β-actin panel in Fig 3D and PA700 panel in Fig 4A. There were discrepancies between the published panels and underlying blots, and the concerns were not fully resolved.
The corresponding author stated that the β-actin panels are identical in Figs 3E and 4B, and Figs 3F and 4C, respectively. They stated that these figures present the same samples, and they apologise that these intentional duplications of the loading controls were not declared in the figure legends. Images described as the underlying blots for PA700 and β-actin in Fig 4C did not appear to match the published panels.
The corresponding author stated that experiments related to Fig 3 and Fig 4 were conducted between the years 2006–2009. They indicated that experiments were performed in batches but did not provide specific information about when each of the presented experiments were performed. Files provided for PA700 and IP: 3-NT/IB:PA700 in Fig 4B suggest that the western blots were performed at different times. The Editors remain concerned regarding the discrepancy in dates and the lack of clarity about whether experimental results presented together were collected at the same time.
In light of the concerns about the reliability of these data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
JX and MHZ did not agree with the retraction. SA responded but expressed neither agreement nor disagreement with the retraction. SW, MZ, and QW either did not respond directly or could not be reached. JX and MHZ stand by the article’s findings.

Each sample was electrophoresed in triplicate. At the end of electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane and membrane was sliced vertically into three pieces:
-Slice # 1: The membrane was sliced horizontally into two pieces; one probed for Bcl-2 and the other for survivin. The blot for Bcl-2 was stripped and reprobed for Bcl-xL.
-Slice # 2: The membrane was probed for c-Myc, then stripped and reprobed first for cyclin D1, and then with COX-2.
-Slice # 3: The membrane was sliced horizontally into two pieces, one was probed for MMP9 and the other for CXCR4. The latter was stripped and reprobed for *-actin.

After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about the mouse tumor sizes reported in Figure 2. Specifically:
The chart in Figure 2B of the article [1] reports tumour sizes of up to 5500 Photons/cm2/sec/steradian, with a standard error of approximately 1500 Photons/cm2/sec/steradian.
he chart in Figure 2D of the article [1] reports tumour sizes of up to 23 cm3, with a standard error of approximately 6 cm3.
The journal asked the corresponding author to provide the individual-level data underlying these results and information about humane endpoints and health monitoring during the tumour experiments. In response, the corresponding author stated that they no longer have access to the data or the requested information.
PLOS ONE Editors consulted an expert in animal welfare and animal research methodology about this case. The expert assessed the article and noted that since these tumours are implanted orthotopically and not subcutaneously, typical tumour size limits for subcutaneous humane endpoints do not apply. However, they also stated that weekly monitoring of tumour volume as reported in the article would not have met U.S. standards for mouse tumour studies.
A representative of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center also reviewed this paper in comparison to the animal research protocol approved by the IACUC in 2009 for this study (10-05-11032). They stated that what is reported in the article [1] is not in compliance with the approved IACUC protocol. The IACUC therefore recommended retraction of the article.
In light of the above concerns and the information received from the IACUC representative, PLOS ONE Editors concluded that the study did not comply with the journal’s Animal Research Policy. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article. The editors regret that these concerns were not identified prior to the article’s publication.

During additional experiments carried out at our laboratory, we discovered that the strain PXO99Dax21 employed in the study was mixed up with another strain in our collection. This compromises the validity of Figures 1, 2 and 3 in the article as we are unsure as to whether the correct strain was employed in the studies.
We have taken steps to repeat the experiments but we have been unable to validate the knockout mutants generated so far. We have also attempted to replicate the work using strains obtained from another group, but in our hands, those strains did not infect rice plants.

The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article (Yang et al. 2012) following an investigation by the University of Liverpool. The investigation concluded that data contained in this paper demonstrate evidence of data manipulation and figure fabrication relating to mass-spectrometry data and are therefore unreliable. The investigation found no evidence that the mass-spectrometry was carried out on any University of Liverpool instrumentation from systematic examination of equipment logs. This does not exclude the fact that the mass-spectrometry may have been undertaken at another research center. However, they found no evidence that the mass-spectrometry was performed anywhere else or any financial audit trail to indicate that instrument time was paid for elsewhere. Figure 1 trace A1 demonstrates mismatches between the stated mass and where the spectra align and mislabeling of the y axis. In Fig. 1 trace A2, there are mismatches between the peaks and axis masses, inconsistencies in the presence of a zero in the second decimal place and the presence of hollow bars instead of lines for peaks. In Fig. 1 trace A3, there are mismatches between the peaks and the axis masses, inconsistencies in the graduation of the mz axis – there appears to have the graduation of another axis superimposed on it – and the presence of hollow bars instead of lines for peaks. In Fig. 1 trace A2 and A3, the traces have been modified, but there are duplicated areas still visible. In Fig. 1 trace B1, there are mismatches between the peaks and the axis masses, mislabeling of the y axis, inconsistencies in the graduation of the mz axis and the presence of hollow bars instead of lines for peaks. In Fig. 1 trace B2, Fig. 1 trace B3, Fig. 1 trace C1 and Fig. 1 trace C2, there are mismatches between the peaks and the axis masses and the presence of hollow bars instead of lines for peaks. The co-authors of the article were found by the investigation not to be complicit in any research misconduct, and they have been invited to resubmit a revised version of the manuscript for further peer review. More information on the university's investigation can be found on the university website (Further update on research misconduct investigation 2020).
All authors agree to this retraction.
The Editors-in-Chief would like to alert readers that this article (Yang et al. 2012) is part of an investigation being conducted by the journal following the conclusions of an institutional enquiry at the University of Liverpool with respect to the quantitative mass spectrometry-generated results regarding acetylated and redox-modified HMGB1. Appropriate editorial action will be taken once the investigation is concluded.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following publication, concerns were raised about similarities between this article [1] and an article published earlier by the same group in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine [2]. The two articles reported experiments addressing the same overall research questions but in different squamous cell carcinoma cell lines of tongue origin (OSC19 [1] and SCC13 [2]). The conclusions are largely overlapping, and there is substantial text overlap between the two articles in the Introduction, Discussion, and Conclusions. The BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine article was not cited or discussed in the PLOS ONE article, and the two articles were under review during overlapping time periods.
In addition, concerns were raised about similarities between figures in the two articles:
Fig 1A (FaDu panel) in the PLOS ONE article [1] is identical to Fig 1A (A431 panel) in [2], though these panels reportedly show results from different cell lines. The University of Alabama at Birmingham confirmed that there are no original data available to determine the cell line that was used in either article, and so the conclusion regarding the invasive potential of OSC19 cells versus squamous cell carcinoma cells from other head and neck sites is not supported.
Fig 7 in the PLOS ONE article [1] is a modified version of Fig 6 in [2]. The BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine article was not cited as the foundation of the PLOS ONE Figure.
Following a joint investigation by the Birmingham VA Medical Center and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the institutions requested retraction of this article, as the conclusions could not be supported by available data. In light of the above issues, and in line with the institutions’ recommendation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

The two articles reported experiments addressing the same overall research questions but in different squamous cell carcinoma cell lines of tongue origin (OSC19 [1] and SCC13 [2]). The conclusions are largely overlapping, and there is substantial text overlap between the two articles in the Introduction, Discussion, and Conclusions. The BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine article was not cited or discussed in the PLOS ONE article, and the two articles were under review during overlapping time periods.
In addition, concerns were raised about similarities between figures in the two articles:
Fig 1A (FaDu panel) in the PLOS ONE article [1] is identical to Fig 1A (A431 panel) in [2], though these panels reportedly show results from different cell lines. The University of Alabama at Birmingham confirmed that there are no original data available to determine the cell line that was used in either article, and so the conclusion regarding the invasive potential of OSC19 cells versus squamous cell carcinoma cells from other head and neck sites is not supported. Fig 7 in the PLOS ONE article [1] is a modified version of Fig 6 in [2]. The BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine article was not cited as the foundation of the PLOS ONE Figure. Following a joint investigation by the Birmingham VA Medical Center and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the institutions requested retraction of this article, as the conclusions could not be supported by available data. In light of the above issues, and in line with the institutions’ recommendation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

The co-corresponding authors, Drs. Koretzky and Jordan, are retracting this publication due to their discovery that many of the figures prepared by the first listed author do not accurately represent the data from the underlying experiments. The primary issues discovered with this publication are listed below:
(1) The data presented in Fig. 1 A include inappropriate gating, inappropriate controls, and use of different cell populations than indicated.
(2) The data presented in Fig. 2 D include inappropriate gating, inappropriate controls, and use of different cell populations than indicated.
(3) The data presented in Fig. 3 A include the use of a different cytokine than indicated, and the data presented in Fig. 3 D include inappropriate gating.
(4) The data presented in several panels of Fig. 4 C were not derived from the correct congenic allele and inappropriate gates were used.
(5) The data presented in Fig. 5 D were not derived from the correct congenic marker, and the histograms in Fig. 5 E do not accurately depict the cell populations indicated.
As a consequence, any conclusions based on these data remain unsupported. None of the other authors were aware of these inaccuracies at the time of submission and review. All of the authors have agreed to this retraction.

+Concerns/Issues About Image","After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about results reported in Figs 5 and 7.
Specifically:
In the left panels in Fig 5, similarities were noted between the elongated GFAP-stained cells sections in the non-treated Oxygen-injured retinas and in the DMSO-treated Oxygen-injured retinas.
In Fig 5, there appears to be a region of overlap in the left panels shown for non-treated Oxygen-injured retina (see area marked as B) and the DMSO-treated Oxygen-injured retina (see area marked as A).
Concerns were raised about the quality and presentation of western blot data reported in Fig 7. Given the brightness/contrast levels of images in this figure and the vertical lines separating lanes, one cannot confirm the integrity of the images or clarify whether the lanes for each experiment show data from the same blot and exposure. In addition, there appear to be horizontal discontinuities below bands shown in lanes 2, 3 of the upper GFAP panel, and vertical discontinuities around the bands shown in both β-actin panels.
The authors were unable to resolve these issues or provide the original data underlying the results in response to journal queries. Without the original data we cannot resolve the above concerns which call into question the validity of the reported results.
In light of these concerns, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
Per FAAM and FHAM, the underlying data for this study were held by MD for whom current contact information is not available. The journal has not received confirmation that MD received communications about this case.
FHAM and FAAM replied to our notification but did not specify agreement or disagreement with the retraction. MD either could not be reached or did not reply.

Dozens of papers co-authored by Nobel laureate raise concerns.
Editorial observation: Concerns about the data in this paper were posted on PubPeer almost 8 years ago. To state in the retraction notice that the “authors have retracted this article” seems unnecessarily indifferent to the efforts of the people who originally flagged the concerns.

Could the authors post full original blots here?
2021 correction. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-020-01618-z
Since publication of the article the authors noticed the following errors:
(1) The actin immunoblot (loading control) from Fig. 6B was mistakenly included in Fig. 6G. The correct actin immunoblot is attached. It demonstrates that there was equal loading in all of the lanes.
(2) The three panels in Fig. 1A (HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, and actin immunoblots) are identical to three panels in Fig. 1B of Gilkes et al. (Cancer Res. 73:3285, 2013). These are validation immunoblots for knockdown subclones, which were generated through the combined effort of the first authors of the Oncogene and Cancer Research papers.
We regret the two errors that were made. They do not alter any of the paper’s conclusions.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about results reported in Figures 3 and 7.
Specifically:
The APMV-1 (BC) and APMV-8 panels of Figure 3A in [1] appear similar to the APMV-1 (BC) and rAPMV-4/ Fc SV panels, respectively, of Figure 5 in [2]. The authors confirmed the same APMV-1 (BC) image was used in both figures; they stated that the two experiments were conducted simultaneously and that the same APMV-1 control applied to both. Regarding the APMV-8 [1] and rAPMV-4/ Fc SV [2] panels, the authors commented that data reuse may have resulted from an error in figure assembly.
The Mock-infected panels of Figure 7A and 7B in [1] appear similar to the Uninfected Trachea panel in Figure 5A and Uninfected Lung panel in Figure 5B, respectively, in [3]. The authors confirmed that the same controls were used in the indicated figures. They noted that the experiments were conducted at nearly the same time and that controls were reused because the number of animals was limited.
The authors noted that the original data underlying the results reported in this article are no longer available due to the amount of time that has passed since the experiments were conducted. There are six instances where the Results section refers to data not shown, and the data underlying those statements are likewise not available.
In light of the above issues, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
SKS agreed with retraction. HS agreed with retraction and apologizes for the issues with the published article. PLC agreed with retraction, stands by the article’s findings, and apologized for the issues with the published article. S-HK did not agree with retraction and stands by the article’s findings. SX either could not be reached or did not respond directly.
Mock-infected panels of Figure 7A and 7B in [1] report material from [3], published 2011 by American Society for Microbiology, which are not offered under a CC-BY license and are therefore excluded from this article’s [1] license.

It reads:
""After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about results reported in Figures 3 and 7.
Specifically:
The APMV-1 (BC) and APMV-8 panels of Figure 3A in [1] appear similar to the APMV-1 (BC) and rAPMV-4/ Fc SV panels, respectively, of Figure 5 in [2]. The authors confirmed the same APMV-1 (BC) image was used in both figures; they stated that the two experiments were conducted simultaneously and that the same APMV-1 control applied to both. Regarding the APMV-8 [1] and rAPMV-4/ Fc SV [2] panels, the authors commented that data reuse may have resulted from an error in figure assembly.
The Mock-infected panels of Figure 7A and 7B in [1] appear similar to the Uninfected Trachea panel in Figure 5A and Uninfected Lung panel in Figure 5B, respectively, in [3]. The authors confirmed that the same controls were used in the indicated figures. They noted that the experiments were conducted at nearly the same time and that controls were reused because the number of animals was limited.
The authors noted that the original data underlying the results reported in this article are no longer available due to the amount of time that has passed since the experiments were conducted. There are six instances where the Results section refers to data not shown, and the data underlying those statements are likewise not available.
In light of the above issues, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

Concerns were raised by one of the Co-Authors and the University of Liverpool regarding the reliability and replicability of the research undertaken into the HMGB1 isoforms, including their potential use to inform mechanisms, diagnosis and prognosis of various disease states.
After numerous subsequent analyses, the assays and data for cytokeratin 18 and total HMGB1 have proven to be reproducible, either from direct reanalyses or from parallel studies.
The Authors were able to re-analyse a subset of 35 original clinical samples for total HMGB1 (using the same commercial ELISA assay as that used in the paper) and found a strong correlation with the original data. We have re-analysed clinical samples from a separate paracetamol overdose patient cohort for these markers (and reported in a separate paper, Risk stratification after paracetamol overdose using mechanistic biomarkers: results from two prospective cohort studies; J.W. Dear, J.I. Clarke, B. Francis, L. Allen, J. Wraight, J. Shen, et al.; Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2018 Feb; 3(2):104–113 PMID: 29146439). The analyses again showed a strong correlation. Furthermore, the repeat keratin 18 analyses from this second cohort, together with separate work by one of the paper’s co-authors, Dr Ken Simpson, on a study of acute liver failure patients following paracetamol overdose (Circulating apoptotic and necrotic cell death markers in patients with acute liver injury; D.G.N. Craig, P. Lee, E.A. Pryde, G.S. Masterton, P.C. Hayes, K.J. Simpson; Liver International, 31(8) (2011) pp. 1127–1136 PMID: 21745283) replicated the findings for both forms of this biomarker.
The Authors are therefore confident that the bioanalytical readouts and clinical implications from the original total HMGB1, caspase-cleaved keratin 18 and total keratin 18 data are correct.
However, in respect to acetylated HMGB1, after various approaches and reanalyses the methodology cannot be reproduced as described in the paper and therefore the authors and the University of Liverpool have been unable to verify whether the data for this analyte are correct and reproducible.
The method for acetylated HMGB1 quantification has two main components: isolation of the HMGB1 analyte from clinical samples using immunoprecipitation and subsequent protein digestion and mass spectrometric analysis of the HMGB1 peptides. The Authors are confident that the mass spectrometry protocol is robust but they have been unable to recapitulate the immunoprecipitation and digestion. They are working on new methods, with collaborators, to identify all HMGB1 isoforms.
As a consequence of the above, and the central importance of the acetylated HMGB1 data to the scientific trustworthiness, the decision has been made to retract the paper.","2020 retraction. https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(20)33554-6/fulltext

""After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about results reported in Figs 1, 3 and 5.
Specifically:
Similarities were noted between the following western blot data reported in [1] and [2]. In each case, the similar results are used to represent different experiments and/or conditions in the two articles.
Figure 1A NDRG2 blot in [1], lanes 1–2, appears similar to the Figure 2D VEGF blot in [2], flipped horizontally.
Figure1A NDRG2 blot in [1], lanes 3–5, appears similar to the Figure 2E VEGF blot in [2], flipped horizontally.
Figure 1A β-actin blot in [1], lanes 3–5, appears similar to the Figure 2E β-actin blot in [2], flipped horizontally.
The β-actin blot in Fig 1B appears similar to the β-actin blot in Fig 4C for the Normoxia condition. The upper left area in Fig 3A, Ad-NDRG2 panel appears similar to the lower right area of the control panel in Figure 7C of [3], for which copyright is held by the American Cancer Society. The following pairs of panels in Fig 5B appear to report overlapping data:
VHL immunolabelling, Control and Ad-LacZ panels
HIF-1α immunolabelling, Control and Ad-LacZ panels
The corresponding authors requested retraction and commented that in reviewing the lab records they found that there had been errors in data management and figure preparation.
The underlying data to support this article’s results are no longer available.
In light of the unresolved concerns and in line with the corresponding author’s request, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
WL, JZ, and LY agreed with retraction and apologized for the issues with the published article. JM, XY, QW, QZ, YX, HR, LW, YC, SL, and LM either could not be reached or did not respond directly.

1. Concern about Figure 3.
Panel “Ad-NDRG2” in Figure 3A appears to be derived from the same image as “control” in Figure 7C of an older paper by the same first author, i.e. “Ras Homolog Gene Family, Member A Promotes p53 Degradation and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Dependent Angiogenesis Through an Interaction With Murine Double Minute 2 Under Hypoxic Conditions”, by Ji Ma et al., Cancer, September 2012, DOI: 10.1002/cncr.27393.
2. Concern about Figure 5B.
Panels “Control/VHL” and “Ad-LacZ/VHL” appear to be derived from the same original image. There is a region of overlap.
In addition, Panels “Control/HIF-1alpha” and “Ad-LacZ/HIF-1alpha” appear to be derived from the same original image. There is a region of overlap.

A scientific misconduct investigation by University of Colorado Denver (Anschutz Medical Campus) concluded that this paper contains falsified and/or fabricated data. Specifically, Figures 1 and 3: Some LC-MS peak areas in the β-blocker transport data reported in these figures were falsified to create smooth monotonic transport curves with smaller error bars.
Tables 2, 3; Figures 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10: All use the primary transport data from curves in Figures 1 and 3, hence the analyses reported will all be contaminated by falsified data from Figure 1 and/or Figure 3.

+Duplication of Image","Journal of Neurotrauma has been notified by the Acting Director of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) of two published articles in the Journal where the authors engaged in research misconduct by falsifying and/or fabricating data by falsely reporting the results of Western blot experiments that examined neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, and/or congntive impairment in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. Specifically, the authors duplicated, reused, and falsely relabeled Western blot gel images and claimed they represented different experiments in a number of published articles in the scientific literature.
Acting in compliance with ORI, and in the interest of upholding the strictest standards of scientific publishing, the editorial leadership of Journal of Neurotrauma agrees that the research misconduct is of such significance as to warrant retraction of the following articles:

Details as to the donor sources and methods of obtaining informed consent from donors were not reported in [1], and when following up on these concerns the authors did not clarify these issues or the cause(s) of donor death in response to journal inquiries. International ethical standards call for transparency in organ donor and transplantation programs and clear informed consent procedures including considerations to ensure that donors are not subject to coercion [3,4,5].
The authors stated that no vulnerable populations were involved in their research and they provided a letter from the Ethics Committee of Human Organ Transplantation at First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University which confirmed that the organ donations involved in the article took place 2001–2012, and that these organ donations received ethics approval and conformed to local regulations. However, the authors did not provide donor consent forms in response to the journal’s request, and the document provided by the Ethics Committee of Human Organ Transplantation did not specifically support the authors’ claim about vulnerable populations or clarify whether organs had been procured from prisoners.
In addition, the Methods section of [1] did not include sufficient information about participant recruitment for the study; the recruitment site(s) and inclusion and exclusion criteria were not reported.
The authors did not respond to inquiries about the availability of underlying data supporting this study.
Owing to the lack of documentation to demonstrate this study had prospective ethical approval, insufficient reporting, unresolved concerns around the source of transplanted organs and whether they included organs from prisoners, and in compliance with international ethical standards for organ/tissue donation and transplantation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The corresponding author notified the journal that all authors disagree with the retraction. XY confirmed their disagreement, the other authors either could not be reached or did not respond directly.

Following the publication of the above article, the authors wish to retract the paper for the following reasons. We have further investigated the mechanism of adipose stem cell-conditioned medium in promoting the migration of vascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and have identified that the adipose stem cell-conditioned medium is unable to promote vascular endothelial cell migration at the same rate, or to the same extent. The explanation may be that the vascular endothelial cells used in this study were a cell line, whereas fibroblasts and keratinocytes are primary cells with very different characteristics. Therefore, the experimental results thus obtained suffered from a lack of rigor and scientific accuracy due to the inappropriate selection and application of the cell types used in this study.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following publication of this work [1], concerns were raised about the following:
Fig 2E Actin panel appears similar to lanes 2–4 of the GAPDH panel in Fig 7D. These panels also appear similar to images in Fig 2A (Actin), Fig 2B (Actin), Fig 4A (NS5A), 4B (NS5A), 7D (Actin), and 9A (Actin panel) of a 2003 article published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry [2] by the corresponding author of [1]. The 2003 publication has been withdrawn [3], and the withdrawal notice for that article notes similarity of the image in question to figures in several other articles.
Fig 7B Albumin panel lanes 2,3 flipped horizontally appear similar to Fig 1A ASC panel lanes 3,4 in a 2016 article published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry [4] by two of the authors of [1]. The 2016 article has been withdrawn [5], and the withdrawal notice indicates similarity between this image and figures published in several other articles, including two published in 2010 and 2012 [6, 7].
While the authors stand by the validity of the experimental data and the conclusions reached in the study, they were unable to provide original images or underlying data for Figs 2E, 7D and 7E.
In light of the image concerns and the unavailability of the underlying data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
GW did not agree with retraction. LDP and SM did not respond.
Owing to the concerns about similarities with previously published content [2–7] that is not licensed for reproduction and distribution under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, Fig 2E Actin panel, Fig 7B Albumin panel, and Fig 7D GAPDH panel have been removed from the retracted article [1].

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figures 5 and 6. Specifically,
The Figure 5A ESTDAB049 and ESTDAB075 Actin panels appear similar.
The following FACS panels in Figure 6 appear more similar than would be expected from independent samples:
The top and bottom left quadrants of the Untransfected ESTDAB049, Untransfected ESTDAB075, and Untransfected ESTDAB081 panels.
The top and bottom left quadrants of the Control siRNA ESTDAB049, Control siRNA ESTDAB075, and Control siRNA ESTDAB081 panels.
The bottom right quadrants of the Control siRNA ESTDAB075 and Control siRNA ESTDAB081 panels.
The Untransfected A375, Control siRNA A375, and siRNA treated A375 panels.
The top left quadrants of the Untransfected ESTDAB112 and Control siRNA ESTDAB112 panels.
The Control siRNA T47D and siRNA treated T47D panels.
Regarding Figure 5A, the corresponding author confirmed that the ESTDAB075 Actin panel was inadvertently duplicated and offered a replacement figure to correct the ESTDAB049 Actin panel.
Regarding Figure 6, the corresponding author stated that the ESTDAB cell lines are very similar to one another in size and granularity. Furthermore, the corresponding author stated that although parts of the panels appear similar, clear differences in apoptosis and necrosis can be seen between the untransfected, control siRNA, and siRNA transfected samples. The explanation provided does not clarify the concerns pertaining to the high level of similarity observed between multiple panels presented in this figure.
The corresponding author stated that the raw data underlying the results presented in Figures 5 and 6 are no longer available.
In light of the unresolved concerns with Figure 6 that question the validity and reliability of the reported results, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
All authors disagree with the retraction decision.

I thank the authors for replying and explaining their point of view. I thought I'd respond in kind.
Peer Review. Your comments that the paper was peer reviewed are a reflexive rebuttal used by many authors. However, every paper for which a correction or retraction is published are also for peer-reviewed papers, so this rebuttal holds little weight. Peer review is certainly not a certification that everything published in a paper is perfect or irrefutable.
Original Data. It is understandable that original data may not be available on older papers. I don't think anyone would dispute this.
Citation Number. The number of citations that a paper has received has no bearing on whether a paper contains problematic data. There are lots of examples of authors citing papers that have already been retracted, to illustrate my point. Read here for examples, including one paper that was cited 1919 times before retraction and 816 times after retraction.
Figure 5A. I agree with the authors that the duplication of the band is likely to be accidental. Without access to the raw data, one can not make a definitive determination either way, but I don't think Figure 5A by itself is particularly concerning, even with an unfixable error.
Figure 6. Here is where the authors and I will disagree. Rather than pointing to unrelated papers, it would help to hear an explanation from the authors about how two or more plots (like the two shown below from Figure 6) can show data points that are placed in identical positions. I pick this simple example because it seems beyond dispute that the two outlined areas with only 4 dots are identical. From talking with experts in the field, this identical placement is highly unusual, even between 2 plots, yet we can see innumerable examples of this throughout Figure 6, some of which were outlined in the post in #2 by Dr. Bik. Other experts and the journal apparently cannot see any reason that this could occur by chance.
My questions for the authors for Figure 6. Can the authors offer their own explanation for how the plots in Figure 6 could appear to overlap by chance? I didn't see this mentioned in the above reply. Perhaps the authors can contact the flow cytometer manufacturer to see if they can offer an explanation of how the plots in Figure 6 could accidentally overlap as published. If you are able to obtain a statement from them, it would helpful if you could post it here.
Absent an explanation for how the overlapping flow cytometry plots could occur by chance, I do not think it is unexpected for a journal to lose confidence in the authenticity of the published data.
One area of overlap outlined in red.
Unfortunately, Plos One come back to us after more than 10 years that paper was published in 2013. Data belongs to period 2010 to 2011. paper was peer reviewed by 3 reviewers. after around 10+13 years, we could not find original data in our computers, due to some problems that might happen for anyone. Our paper reviewed 68 citation and all data were confirmed by papers that were published after.
The only mistake that we admitted was Figure 5A: the ESTDAB049 Actin and ESTDAB075 Actin panels appear that happened due to technical issue.
1- Still, we cannot believe that Journal retracted our paper describing the effects of ROR1 in survival of Melanoma cell lines, just based on speculations. 2- Being honest in research is a basic issue for all researchers around the world. Plos One should know that retracting a paper based on a Figure (Figure 6) is not fair and moral at all. If their specialists check similar papers, they will see the same figures with similar data (see below). 3- We refer Plos One specialists to check carefully a paper published in a prestigious Journal PHARMACCOLOGIC RESEARCH (Figure 1D and 1F, PMID: 35367343, DOI: 10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106198). Similar pattern can be seen in these figures tested the effects of Andrographolide (AD) on 2 different lung cancer cell lines. 4- As mentioned, retracting a paper based on a Figure is not fair and, even we trust our data in Figure 6, at least we can delete the figure and describe it in the text and send you the revised paper for publication. This has been notified in Ethical Publishing Practice, and we have the right CLARIFY THE SCIENTIFIC RECORD (EVEN WE DO NOT ACCEPT ANY MISTAKE, BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT TO PREVENT UNFAIR RETRACTION). PLOS will investigate concerns raised about PLOS submissions or publications regardless of the time since publication or study completion, and regardless of whether issues are raised internally, by authors, or by anonymous, pseudonymous, or named third parties. We will take steps to correct or clarify the scientific record if necessary, which may include issuing a correction, expression of concern, or retraction. If we anticipate a delayed or prolonged follow-up period PLOS may post an interim notice on the article(s) in question to make readers aware of the issues raised.

""Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figures 5 and 6. Specifically,
The Figure 5A ESTDAB049 and ESTDAB075 Actin panels appear similar.
The following FACS panels in Figure 6 appear more similar than would be expected from independent samples:
The top and bottom left quadrants of the Untransfected ESTDAB049, Untransfected ESTDAB075, and Untransfected ESTDAB081 panels.
The top and bottom left quadrants of the Control siRNA ESTDAB049, Control siRNA ESTDAB075, and Control siRNA ESTDAB081 panels.
The bottom right quadrants of the Control siRNA ESTDAB075 and Control siRNA ESTDAB081 panels.
The Untransfected A375, Control siRNA A375, and siRNA treated A375 panels.
The top left quadrants of the Untransfected ESTDAB112 and Control siRNA ESTDAB112 panels.
The Control siRNA T47D and siRNA treated T47D panels.
Regarding Figure 5A, the corresponding author confirmed that the ESTDAB075 Actin panel was inadvertently duplicated and offered a replacement figure to correct the ESTDAB049 Actin panel.
Regarding Figure 6, the corresponding author stated that the ESTDAB cell lines are very similar to one another in size and granularity. Furthermore, the corresponding author stated that although parts of the panels appear similar, clear differences in apoptosis and necrosis can be seen between the untransfected, control siRNA, and siRNA transfected samples. The explanation provided does not clarify the concerns pertaining to the high level of similarity observed between multiple panels presented in this figure.
The corresponding author stated that the raw data underlying the results presented in Figures 5 and 6 are no longer available.
In light of the unresolved concerns with Figure 6 that question the validity and reliability of the reported results, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
All authors disagree with the retraction decision.""
Figure 6.
Several quadants of the flow cytometry panels appear to look similar to each other. Gated percentages and other quadrants, however, are different.
Concerns about figures in this paper have been reported to the journal in 2015. However, no action has yet been taken.

Figure 10 again, more repeated features in some of the other images, and there are more.

There are also repeated areas within panel PN.
There appear to be some similar features in the tissues published in figure 10. This is not expected between different animals, and might suggest these are serial sections of the same animal instead. Thank you to the anonymous social media user who assisted.

Dear Biskrensis,
Thank you for bringing it to our notice after a decade of its publication. Yes, it is a composite image of different fields of view represented in one image and we really apologize for the image having been placed twice in the same composite image Panel Figure 2A.
Please find attached the corrected image for your reference.
We will ask the Journal to incorporate the corrections.
Regards

Dr. Bhartiya - I did not see a description that the image was a composite; I apologize if I missed that. Current editorial policies suggest that it would not be acceptable to juxtapose images without noting that this has been done. If this was not previously disclosed, perhaps you should correspond with the journal to see if they have any concern.
Firstly - even if I am on the board of the journal- it does not affect review process and we also face similar strict and blinded review. So this comment is not valid at all. This paper was published in 2013

The Editor-in-Chief and Publisher have retracted this article [1] because the scientific integrity of the content cannot be guaranteed. An investigation by the Publisher found it to be one of a group of articles we have identified as showing evidence suggestive of attempts to subvert the peer review and publication system to inappropriately obtain or allocate authorship. This article showed evidence of plagiarism (most notably from the articles cited [2–7]) and peer review and authorship manipulation.

+Concerns/Issues About Results
+Concerns/Issues About Image","After publication of this article [1], the following concerns were raised about the published figures:
The FUT8 panel in Fig 2B appears similar to the ST6Gal1 panel in Fig 6A when horizontally flipped;
There are similarities between cell staining patterns in the following panels of Fig 4B and 4C in [1] and the indicated panels of Fig 3A and 3B in [2]:
○
0 μg/ml panel of Fig 4B [1] and 16h panel of Fig 3B [2];
○
5 μg/ml panel of Fig 4B [1] and 20 μg/ml panel of Fig 3A [2];
○
0 hr panel of Fig 4C [1] and 8h panel of Fig 3B [2];
Several stained cells in Fig 4B and 4C appear to have highly similar morphologies and staining patterns;
Areas within Fig 4B (1 and 10 μg/ml panels) of [1] are similar to data shown in Fig 2D and 2E of [3];
An area within the 0 μg/ml panel of Fig 4B [1] appears similar to data shown in the Hca-F and control siRNA panels of Fig 3A in [4]; the upper portion of the 5 μg/ml panel in Fig 4B [1] is similar to a region of the COL8A1 siRNA panel in Fig 3A of [4];
There are clusters of stained cells that appear to be duplicated within and across panels of Fig 5B and 6B in [1]. Also, within the first panel of Fig 6B the left portion of the panel appears to be duplicated and flipped vertically in the central portion of the panel.
We raised these concerns to the authors, who apologized and provided supporting image files as well as replication data for the results in question. However, the image data provided did not resolve the published image concerns. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article due to concerns about the integrity, validity, and reliability of the published results.
All authors agreed with the retraction.
Note: Permissions were not obtained to use the images described above in the second, fourth, and fifth bullet points, in Fig 4B and 4C of this PLOS ONE article [1], and so those images are excluded from the article’s CC-BY license.

After publication of this article [1], the following concerns were raised about the published figures:
The FUT8 panel in Fig 2B appears similar to the ST6Gal1 panel in Fig 6A when horizontally flipped; There are similarities between cell staining patterns in the following panels of Fig 4B and 4C in [1] and the indicated panels of Fig 3A and 3B in [2]: ○. 0 μg/ml panel of Fig 4B [1] and 16h panel of Fig 3B [2]; ○. 5 μg/ml panel of Fig 4B [1] and 20 μg/ml panel of Fig 3A [2]; ○. 0 hr panel of Fig 4C [1] and 8h panel of Fig 3B [2]; Several stained cells in Fig 4B and 4C appear to have highly similar morphologies and staining patterns; Areas within Fig 4B (1 and 10 μg/ml panels) of [1] are similar to data shown in Fig 2D and 2E of [3]; An area within the 0 μg/ml panel of Fig 4B [1] appears similar to data shown in the Hca-F and control siRNA panels of Fig 3A in [4]; the upper portion of the 5 μg/ml panel in Fig 4B [1] is similar to a region of the COL8A1 siRNA panel in Fig 3A of [4]; There are clusters of stained cells that appear to be duplicated within and across panels of Fig 5B and 6B in [1]. Also, within the first panel of Fig 6B the left portion of the panel appears to be duplicated and flipped vertically in the central portion of the panel. We raised these concerns to the authors, who apologized and provided supporting image files as well as replication data for the results in question. However, the image data provided did not resolve the published image concerns. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article due to concerns about the integrity, validity, and reliability of the published results.
All authors agreed with the retraction.

After this article [1] was published, a Correction was published [2] to address the following issues involving Fig 2:
In Fig 2B1, the plots shown in SNB19 and LN229 control panels appeared similar in the original publication. LN229 Control and Scrambled panels were replaced in the updated version of this figure provided with the Correction. In Fig 2D1, there appeared to be areas of overlap between the images shown in SNB19 Control, Scrambled, and 30a-5p AS panels. The Control and Scrambled panels were replaced in the updated figure provided with the Correction. Additional concerns were subsequently raised about results reported in Figs 3 and 5. Specifically:
In Fig 3A, when levels are adjusted there appear to be horizontal and vertical lines or discontinuities around some cells, e.g. in the SNB19, 30a-5p AS CyclinD1 panel and the LN229, Control CyclinD1 panel. The corresponding author provided original images in support of these two panels and clarified that in preparing this figure they moved cell images from within the same original microscopy image, bringing more cells into the fields shown in the figure. There are similarities between the following data in Fig 3B and Fig 5: ○. Fig 3B, SNB19 β-actin lanes 2, 3 are similar to Fig 5, LN229 β-actin lanes 4, 3 when flipped horizontally. ○. Fig 3B, SNB19 SEPT7 lanes 2, 3 appear similar to Fig 5, LN229 SEPT7 lanes 4, 3, when flipped horizontally. ○. Fig 3B, LN229 MMP2 lanes 2, 3 appear similar to Fig 5, SNB19 MMP2 lanes 4, 3, when flipped horizontally. ○. Fig 3B LN229 MMP9, lanes 2, 3 appear similar to Fig 5, SNB19 CyclinD1 lanes 4, 3, when flipped horizontally. In response to the western blot concerns, the authors noted that errors were made in preparing the β -actin panels. They provided a replacement image for Fig 3B SNB19 β -actin, and they provided western blot images cropped similarly to the published figure panels (although with additional lanes) to support several panels of Figs 3 and 5. No image data were provided to support the following, which include panels for which concerns were raised: Fig 3B, SNB19 cells, SEPT7, MMP2, MMP9; Fig 3B, LN229 cells, MMP9; and Fig 5, LN229 cells, Bcl2. The SNB19 PCNA image provided for Fig 3B differed from the published figure.
The original unadjusted and uncropped blot images supporting Figs 3 and 5 are not available. Without the original image data, we are unable to resolve the above concerns or verify the reported results.
In light of the above concerns, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
In our discussion of this case, the authors clarified that in the Correction [2], the updated figure panels reported data from the original experiments. The original underlying data for Fig 2 are no longer available.
The authors either could not be reached or did not reply to the retraction notification.

The Editor-in-Chief and Publisher have retracted this article [1] because the scientific integrity of the content cannot be guaranteed. An investigation by the Publisher found it to be one of a group of articles we have identified as showing evidence suggestive of attempts to subvert the peer review and publication system to inappropriately obtain or allocate authorship. This article showed evidence of plagiarism (most notably from the articles cited [2–8]) and peer review and authorship manipulation.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figures 1, 2, 4, and 6. Specifically,
There appear to be horizontal and vertical irregularities suggestive of splice lines in the following panels:
Figure 1c, within lane 4 of the Caspase 3 panel.
Figure 2a, just above the 90kDa marker of the GRASP-1 panel.
Figure 2a, around each individual band in the GRIP1 panel.
Figure 6a, between lanes 7–8 of the GluR2 panel.
Further irregularities have been detected in the background of the following panels:
Figure 4a Rap1 panel, near the lower right edge of the panel there appears to be a truncated fragment of a double band.
Figure 6a GRASP-1 panel, when levels are adjusted to visualize background, the density of the background noise directly surrounding the bands in lanes 5 and 6 does not appear to match the background noise density elsewhere in the blot.
Figure 6a GRIP1 panel, when levels are adjusted to visualize background, there appear to be sharp horizontal and vertical discontinuities in lane 1.
The corresponding author disagreed with the above concerns. They stated that each panel was obtained from a single blot and that the observations are likely the result of image compression artifacts or experimental artifacts such as gel or reagent remnants, or patches intrinsic to the nitrocellulose membranes.
The corresponding author provided image data to support their published western blot results in this [1] and other PLOS ONE articles [2–5]. Per PLOS’ assessment of the data files, the pixel patterns in background areas of blot images provided for multiple panels in [1–5] appear more similar than would be expected for data obtained in independent experiments. The corresponding author stated that the repetitive features in the background noise of the underlying data are likely the result of scanner artifacts.
The data and comments provided to PLOS did not resolve the concerns about the integrity and reliability of the reported data. In light of these issues, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
RGN and HYW did not agree with the retraction. KB, MK, and EF either did not respond directly or could not be reached. HYW stands by the article’s findings.

Further irregularities have been detected in the background of the following panels: Figure 4a Rap1 panel, near the lower right edge of the panel there appears to be a truncated fragment of a double band. Figure 6a GRASP-1 panel, when levels are adjusted to visualize background, the density of the background noise directly surrounding the bands in lanes 5 and 6 does not appear to match the background noise density elsewhere in the blot. Figure 6a GRIP1 panel, when levels are adjusted to visualize background, there appear to be sharp horizontal and vertical discontinuities in lane 1. The corresponding author disagreed with the above concerns. They stated that each panel was obtained from a single blot and that the observations are likely the result of image compression artifacts or experimental artifacts such as gel or reagent remnants, or patches intrinsic to the nitrocellulose membranes.
The corresponding author provided image data to support their published western blot results in this [1] and other PLOS ONE articles [2–5]. Per PLOS’ assessment of the data files, the pixel patterns in background areas of blot images provided for multiple panels in [1–5] appear more similar than would be expected for data obtained in independent experiments. The corresponding author stated that the repetitive features in the background noise of the underlying data are likely the result of scanner artifacts.
The data and comments provided to PLOS did not resolve the concerns about the integrity and reliability of the reported data. In light of these issues, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
RGN and HYW did not agree with the retraction. KB, MK, and EF either did not respond directly or could not be reached. HYW stands by the article’s findings.

The underlying data for Figure 5, which were provided in post-publication discussions, confirmed that tumors up to 8.6 cm3 were observed in these experiments. The authors also confirmed that in some cases tumors exceeded 20 mm in diameter. They provided general information about health monitoring and endpoint guidance at their institution, and noted that animal health was monitored every three days with increased monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms for animals bearing tumors > 1.5 cm in diameter. In response to queries about the experimental endpoints, the authors clarified that they planned the experiments aiming to assess differences in tumor growth and survival, but at five weeks post-implantation they terminated the experiment because they observed three cases in which tumors impaired locomotion. The authors did not provide further study-specific information as to humane endpoint criteria or specific animal welfare considerations.
A member of PLOS ONE’s Animal Research Advisory Group assessed the article and the authors’ comments and confirmed that the tumor sizes reported in this article far exceed community standards for humane endpoint limits in mouse tumor studies. The advisor noted that the tumor results present a significant animal welfare and ethical concern.
In light of the above concerns, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article. The editors regret that these concerns were not addressed at the time of the original review process.

I thank PLOS One for conducting an investigation and then retracting this paper for unethical animal husbandry.
Although I first posted this in early 2018 at PubPeer, I did not contact the journal with my concerns until later in 2019. I became motivated to do so when it had become clear that they had put in place sufficient resources to review past papers for ethics and fraud allegations.
This post is part of a series highlighting ethically challenged xenografts in nude mice. In the previous posting, the three mice shown all suffered necroses, implying that this was a general problem for that particular cancer when xenografted
https://pubpeer.com/publications/0FBFCA16FC9A1B27D3969C782A45E4
At least according to these UK-based guidelines, tumours should not exceed 1.5 cm diameter and mice with necrotic xenografts should be terminated within two days
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883160/
In Fig. 5 of this PLOS ONE paper, the control xenografts are much too big. A ruler is helpfully provided, as are the plotted volumes which reach ~6 cm3. Tumours should not be allowed to develop to the point where they impair locomotion.

The Editor-in-Chief and Publisher have retracted this article [1] because the scientific integrity of the content cannot be guaranteed. An investigation by the Publisher found it to be one of a group of articles we have identified as showing evidence suggestive of attempts to subvert the peer review and publication system to inappropriately obtain or allocate authorship. This article showed evidence of plagiarism (most notably from the articles cited [2–4]), peer review and authorship manipulation.

The authors noted that in preparing the figures for this publication [1], the wrong images were presented for the U2-OS cell panel of Fig 3B and shFibulin-5-Hone1/invasion panel of Fig 6D.
In Fig 3B, the images shown as representing fibulin-5 expression in U2-OS cells were instead obtained when examining fibulin-5 expression in a different head and neck cancer cell line.
In Fig 6D, the image shown as representing invasion results for shFibulin-5-Hone1 cells reports data from a different experiment (invasion in siRap-1A-FaDu cells) reported in [3], published 2013 [copyright American Society for Investigative Pathology; published by Elsevier Inc.], and which are not offered under a CC-BY license. This image is therefore excluded from this article's [1] license. At the time of retraction, the article [1] was republished to note this exclusion in the Fig 6 legend and the article’s copyright statement. Replication data for this experiment and the raw data underlying graphs in Fig 6D are available from the authors; the authors noted that quantification data shown in the original version of Fig 6D were obtained using the correct data.
There are several concerns about the western blot figures reported in [1]:
In some cases (e.g. in Fig 9), it is difficult to evaluate the data due to the poor image quality.
For all western blot panels in the article, the background is unexpectedly uniform.
In Fig 1C, when adjusted for brightness and contrast, there appear to be vertical discontinuities between lane 3 and 4 of the Fibulin-5 blot, and there appear to be horizontal discontinuities above and below the bands in all lanes of the Fibulin-5 blot, suggesting that a blot image fragment was superimposed on a gray background image.
In Fig 3C, there are visible splice lines around the bands for the Fibulin-5 Cytoplasm panel.
In Fig 4A, when levels are adjusted there appears to be a vertical discontinuity before lane 2 and we cannot verify whether image data is present in lane 1 (Vehicle control).
In Fig 6A, when adjusted for brightness and contrast, there appear to be vertical and horizontal discontinuities around the band in lane 1 of the Fibulin-5 blot, and we cannot verify whether image data is present in lanes 2, 3. There also appear to be horizontal discontinuities above and below the β-actin bands.
In Fig 7B, when adjusted for brightness and contrast there appear to be vertical discontinuities in the image between lanes 3 and 4 in all three Hone1 blots, and there also appear to be horizontal discontinuities above and below the bands at different positions in lanes 1–3 versus lane 4 for each panel.
In Fig 8B, when levels are adjusted, there are discontinuities in background above and below the bands, and the background for lane 1 appears different than the background for lanes 2, 3. There also appear to be discontinuities above and below the β-actin bands.
The authors noted that the original image data to support the western blot results are no longer available, and that the original data were cropped and/or rearranged, and were superimposed on a gray background image for the purpose of presentation. In light of the data unavailability, we are unable to resolve the above concerns and as such, the reliability and validity of the results are in question.
The authors provided data for a replication of the Fig 3C experiment, but the data provided for this experiment did not appear to be complete uncropped and unadjusted blot images, did not include a supernatant fraction, and the results of nuclear vs. cytoplasm blots did not demonstrate an enrichment in the nucleus as was reported in the Results of [1].
In light of the unresolved concerns discussed above, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
CC and FF agreed with the retraction. LYS, LJS, TC, YY, WW, SY, CCH, CFH, YZ, HT, TH did not reply or could not be reached.

After publication of this article [1], it was reported that the Hone1 cell line, used in the experiments shown in Figs 3–9, is contaminated with HeLa cells [2]. In light of this issue the results reported for this cell line may not be representative of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell biology.

The Editor-in-Chief and Publisher have retracted this article [1] because the scientific integrity of the content cannot be guaranteed. An investigation by the Publisher found it to be one of a group of articles we have identified as showing evidence suggestive of attempts to subvert the peer review and publication system to inappropriately obtain or allocate authorship. This article showed evidence of plagiarism (most notably from the articles cited [2–7]) and peer review and authorship manipulation.

The article is one of four other articles [2–5] published by the same group of authors in 2012 and 2013. It was found to contain duplicated figures and data, where some of the cytokine expression data presented in Table 1 of [2] are repeated in Table 3 of [1], Table 1 of [4], and Table 1 of [5]. Details of the figure duplication are as follows:
Figure 2 (a1 - a4) in [1] are the same as Figure 1d in [2] and Figure 2E in [3].
Figure 4 (a1, b1) in [1] are the same as Figures 2F and 2G in [3] and Figure 3 and 4 in [4].
Figure 6a in [1] is the same as Figure 2H in [3], but rotated, and Figure 2a in [2].
Figure 2 (b1, b3) in [1] are the same as the 1st and 3rd panel of Figure 2 in [5].
Figure 1a in [1] is the same as Figure 2B in [3].
The authors apologize for these errors and agree to the retraction of the article. The author's institution investigated our concerns and concluded that these errors were not the result of academic misconduct. The article is being retracted with the agreement of the journal and the editorial board due to concerns regarding the reliability of the data.

""BioMed Research International has retracted the article titled “Side-by-Side Comparison of the Biological Characteristics of Human Umbilical Cord and Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells” [1]. The article is one of four other articles [2–5] published by the same group of authors in 2012 and 2013. It was found to contain duplicated figures and data, where some of the cytokine expression data presented in Table 1 of [2] are repeated in Table 3 of [1], Table 1 of [4], and Table 1 of [5]. Details of the figure duplication are as follows:
Figure 2 (a1 - a4) in [1] are the same as Figure 1d in [2] and Figure 2E in [3].
Figure 4 (a1, b1) in [1] are the same as Figures 2F and 2G in [3] and Figure 3 and 4 in [4].
Figure 6a in [1] is the same as Figure 2H in [3], but rotated, and Figure 2a in [2].
Figure 2 (b1, b3) in [1] are the same as the 1st and 3rd panel of Figure 2 in [5].
Figure 1a in [1] is the same as Figure 2B in [3].
The authors apologize for these errors and agree to the retraction of the article. The author's institution investigated our concerns and concluded that these errors were not the result of academic misconduct. The article is being retracted with the agreement of the journal and the editorial board due to concerns regarding the reliability of the data.""

The co-Editors-in-Chief and Publisher have retracted this article [1] because the scientific integrity of the content cannot be guaranteed. An investigation by the Publisher found it to be one of a group of articles we have identified as showing evidence suggestive of attempts to subvert the peer review and publication system to inappropriately obtain or allocate authorship. This article showed evidence of plagiarism (most notably from the articles cited [2–6]) and peer review and authorship manipulation.

24626340,"+Concerns/Issues About Image
+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figs 2 and 5. Specifically,
In the Fig 2A Frontal cortex Homer1 panel, there appears to be a horizontal discontinuity in the background above the bands in lanes 1 and 2, as well as horizontal and vertical discontinuities around the top band in lane 4.
The band in the fourth lane of the Fig 2A Frontal cortex mGluR1 panel appears similar to the band in the first lane of the Fig 5A Frontal cortex mGluR1 panel.
The bands in lanes 2 and 3 of the Fig 2A Hippocampus mGluR1 panel appear similar to the bands in the Fig 5A Hippocampus mGluR1 panel.
The corresponding author disagrees with the concerns raised with Figs 2 and 5. Regarding the irregularities in the Fig 2A Homer 1 panel, the corresponding author suggests that the observed irregularities are likely the result of image artifacts or experimental artifacts such as reagent remnants or patches intrinsic to the membrane. Furthermore, the corresponding author stated that the mGluR1 panels presented in Figs 2A and 5A were obtained from separate blots.
The corresponding author provided image data to support their published result in this [1] and other PLOS ONE articles [2–5]. Per PLOS’ assessment of the data files, the pixel patterns in background areas of blot images provided for multiple panels in [1–5] appear more similar than would be expected for data obtained in independent experiments.

From the publisher:
Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figs 2 and 5. Specifically,
In the Fig 2A Frontal cortex Homer1 panel, there appears to be a horizontal discontinuity in the background above the bands in lanes 1 and 2, as well as horizontal and vertical discontinuities around the top band in lane 4. The band in the fourth lane of the Fig 2A Frontal cortex mGluR1 panel appears similar to the band in the first lane of the Fig 5A Frontal cortex mGluR1 panel. The bands in lanes 2 and 3 of the Fig 2A Hippocampus mGluR1 panel appear similar to the bands in the Fig 5A Hippocampus mGluR1 panel. The corresponding author disagrees with the concerns raised with Figs 2 and 5. Regarding the irregularities in the Fig 2A Homer 1 panel, the corresponding author suggests that the observed irregularities are likely the result of image artifacts or experimental artifacts such as reagent remnants or patches intrinsic to the membrane. Furthermore, the corresponding author stated that the mGluR1 panels presented in Figs 2A and 5A were obtained from separate blots.
The corresponding author provided image data to support their published result in this [1] and other PLOS ONE articles [2–5]. Per PLOS’ assessment of the data files, the pixel patterns in background areas of blot images provided for multiple panels in [1–5] appear more similar than would be expected for data obtained in independent experiments. The corresponding author stated that the repetitive features in the background noise of the underlying data are likely the result of scanner artifacts.
The data and comments provided to PLOS did not resolve the concerns about the integrity and reliability of the reported data. In light of these issues, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
HYW did not agree with the retraction and stands by the article’s findings. KB, RP, SKG, MW, and EF either did not respond directly or could not be reached.
Figure 2A.
In the Homer 1 / Frontal cortex blot, unexpected sharp horizontal and vertical background transitions appear to be visible. Of particular note, the top band in the right-most lane appears surrounded by a rectangular box of a different background. Shown with blue arrows.
Here is the full Figure 2A first:
and the detailed view of the Homer 1 / Frontal cortex blot, made darker to bring out more details.
Figure 1B.
Sharp white horizontal lines appear to be visible between the double decker bands in the top right blot (Homer 1 / Hippocampus).
First, here is the full figure 1B:
And here a detail of the top right blot, with red arrows pointing towards the horizontal white lines. I do not see such lines in the top left blot.

Lanes 1–4 of the Fig 3B HMGB1 panel appear similar to the Fig 4A HMGB1 panel (left) when rotated 180°
The Fig 4A HMGB1 panel (right) appears similar to the Fig 4A Tubulin panel (right) when rotated 180°
The Fig 3B and Fig 4A western blot results report Tubulin controls, but the article’s methodology section reports β-actin primers and antibodies instead.
The following panels appear to partially overlap despite being used to represent different experimental conditions:
○ M6 (Fig 6), M6/mock (Fig 6), and M6/Mock (Fig 7)
○ M6/S2 (Fig 6) and M3 (Fig 7)
In addition to these concerns, it has come to the journal’s attention that several cell lines reported in this study have been reported to be misclassified or contaminated. Specifically,
The HepG2 cell line reported in this study as a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line has been misclassified, and should be reported as a hepatoblastoma cell line instead [2].
The BEL-7404 cell line reported in this study as a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line is a contaminated cell line, and has since the publication of this study been shown to be a HeLa derivative cell line instead [3].
The L02 cell line reported in this study as a normal (non-cancerous) hepatocyte line is a contaminated cell line, and has since the publication of this study been shown to be a HeLa derivative cell line instead [4].
The first author commented that the image overlap was the result of errors during figure preparation and provided underlying data and updated figures. Furthermore, the first author stated that they omitted to include the use of tubulin in the methodology section, but this did not clarify why the study’s methodology reports on the use of β-actin instead, when no β-actin results have been presented in this study. In response to the contaminated cell line concerns, the first author states that the BEL-7404 and L02 cell lines were sent to a company for identification, but they did not provide further specification regarding the company or the identification procedure, and they did not provide evidence to confirm the cell lines used were not contaminated.
The first author provided underlying image data for the results presented in Figs 3, 4, 6, and 7, but the individual level data underlying the results in these figures were not provided for editorial review.
In light of the concerns affecting multiple figure panels that question the reliability of these image data, as well as the concerns pertaining to the contamination of cell lines including the control cell line that questions the reliability of the overall results, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

+Duplication of Image","The authors and editors retract this publication [1] following an investigation into concerns around the images presented in several figures. After the publication of this article, readers raised concerns about potential image duplications in Figures 4A-C, 5A-B, 6C, 7A, and 7C. Specifically,
There are similarities between gel bands in Figure 4C and Figure 7B.
The backgrounds and first two lanes of Figures 4A and 7C appear to be identical.
Figure 4B: there are areas of overlap between figures in the WT, QM-CtDGAT2a and QM-CtDGAT2b panels.
Figure 5A: there are duplications between different yeast growth panels within the figure.
Figure 5B: there is a duplication between the left plates for C18:3 and C20:4.
Figure 6C: several yeast growth images appear to be derived from the same source image, involving panels ΔD2, ΔD4 and ΔD5.
Figure 7A: There appear to be areas of overlap between the right panels for ΔD1(1–21) and ΔD5(481–571).
The concerns were brought to the attention of the authors, who provided replicate images of the same experimental sets but were not able to provide the images underlying the figures included in the article.
An institutional investigation conducted by The Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur confirmed the duplication of images and recommended the retraction of the article.
The preparation of the figures falls below the standard of publication; in light of these concerns and in line with the institutional recommendation, the authors and the editors retract this publication.
The authors sincerely apologize to the scientific community for the errors in the published article.

I was Peer 1 above, and I reported these concerns to the journal in April 2014.
An email from Kaitlyn Keller, Publications Manager, PLOS ONE, indicates that this paper is set to be retracted: “In light of these concerns, and following an institutional investigation, we have decided to proceed with the retraction of pone.0111253 and pone.0094472. Additionally, we will be publishing a correction on the third article, pone.0150763.”
Thanks for the notification. We got an email from the editor and currently doing all the necessary action to rectify the issue of figures. We are really sorry for the mistakes in the figures. This things are taken care off.

Agreed.
Also, for the plates on the right-hand side (QM-CtDGAT2b), the top and bottom are the same, but just rotated relative to each other.
I agree with author error need to be corrected but why some cells removed from figure 4B. Can you post the original image.
Peer 5, I admire your passion to set the record straight, but I have reported the case 2 years ago, and it has been reported another time yesterday. I think we now should give the authors a chance to reply and show the original figures. If the authors do so in public, that would be great, but I don't see the need to publish my correspondence in public.
Also, like I pointed out above, I don't think my comments were intentionally deleted. Rather, there might be a duplicate entry for this paper that holds my original comments.
#25
Peer 1, firstly, excellent work. I had not pointed out some of the other issues you raised in Figures 5A and 6C because the quality of the image was not of sufficiently high resolution. But given that this is a relatively new paper (2014), the authors no doubt have all the originals which they should present PLOS in the investigation (also because PLOS is open data policy now).
I continue to be absolutely stunned to know that your figures were deleted. And I think PubPeer needs to offer a formal explanation here because I cannot imagine that comments and extremely important evidence like this just ""poof"" disappeared.
Finally, I wonder if you could please post the email you sent PLOS reporting this case, of course redacting all personal names and emails, but including the date with time when the email was sent, etc. because if you are right, then there has been gross negligence on the part of PLOS. Can you please also list the name(s) of the Editorial Office staff members who claimed that the case was under investigation. There has to be accountability.
Separately, I have contacted the authors, and have also requested them to provide all copies of emails sent to PLOS (the senior author claims to have been in formal contact with the journal in Dec. 2014 and Nov. 2015), so if your email and Dr. Maiti's emails in fact exist and can be presented publicly, then PLOS has alot of explaining to do (which bodes badly for the publisher if we look at just another scandal that hit PLOS recently with the ""hand of the Creator"" paper.
Naturally, ultimately, we seek the academic record corrected, and with so many irregularities in a single paper, I am now extremely curious to see what explanation the authors can offer.
Given the potential for some sort of comment shenanigery, which is not the first time I have observed this at PubPeer, I have taken screen-shots of all comments, just in case.
The following observers are also being updated on this case: COPE, Retraction Watch, Leonid Schneider, Klaas Van Dijk, and others.
This case was reported almost two years ago by me to PLOS ONE, on 16/04/2014.
An Editor Office staff members answered a couple of days later that my email would be forwarded to a senior staff member, with email reference number ref:_00DU0Ifis._500U0Bnlx2:ref.
I cannot find any record of an update after that.

To Peer 5: I am not even sure if I ever commented here, but I am getting updates when a new person replies, and I am Peer 1, suggesting I indeed did. However, for me this page starts with a comment by Unreg March 10th. This might be a glitch of this website, as occasionally papers might be present twice in this system.
Either way, here are the additional possible problems not yet highlighted in the thread above.

I do not know about the peer 1 previous comment which was disappeared. I notice pubpeer comment today and register to answer this comments.

Peer 6, you are responding as if you are an author. Can you please indicate exactly which author wrote this message, please. Also, something sounds very strange. Peer 1 claims that his/her comments were removed or disappeared from PubPeer and that a formal report was made to PLOS in April, 2014. So, something is not congruent between what you are stating and what Peer 1 is stating. This is why Peer 1 urgently needs to repost all the errors or possible errors that he/she detected in Figure 4A, 4C, 6C, 7A, 7B, 7C. If in fact you (the authors) were aware of these errors, and if in fact PLOS was aware of these errors since at least April 2014, then this becomes an extremely serious situation. I will dedicate some time today to draft my own figures of what I perceive to be the problematic figures and will immediately contact the authors and PLOS. As I say, what appears to be a very large inconsistency between what the authors (Peer 6) are stating, and what Peer 1 is stating makes this case very disconcerting.
#8
We already send the corrected images and we are in contact with the journal to correct those errors in the figures already. I again want to thank all the peers to help us to rectify those errors. We are extremely sorry for those errors and will definitely take care of that.
#8
Dear Colleagues we are sorry for the mistakes in the figures and we are working on that to rectify the figures issue. We also notify the mistakes and tried to correct that things. Please don't misjudge us. Every one of us want to do the things correctly. Many thanks for the notification and help. We will try to rectify those errors.
#8
Peer 1, can you please provide proof that your comments disappeared. Can you also repost all of your concerns about all of the figures you list. PLOS seems to be taking concerns more serious in recent weeks after it has come under increasing scrutiny, so it is time to add pressure and relive the issues. Of course, it doesn't help that Peer 3 uses bad language to describe these issues, but I think that I could get a formal investigation underway if you could first please repost all of your concerns. Thank you.
#4
Yes I missed it in fact their are few more problems as pointed out by the peer 1 since i was in hurry so i did not go through to whole article
#4
I would like to say sorry if some got heart from my inappropriate language. I will keep it in mind and will be polite and humble for other.
This paper was already reported to the PLOS One Editors in April 2014, with all of the problems pointed out here, as well as additional problems in Figure 4A, 4C, 6C, 7A, 7B, 7C. Since then, the Editors have not sent any update.
Note: Since I am Peer 1 in this entry, I might have posted figures or comments before, but my earlier comment appears to have disappeared.

Please modify your language Peer 3. You do the site no favors.

The C22:1 just below those you marked is also part of the set.

The Editors have retracted this Article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding the data presented in Figs. 2 and 8. Specifically:
Fig. 2A(c) appears highly similar to Fig. 2c in [1, retracted] and Fig. 2B(b) in [2].
Subpanels of Fig. 8A appear highly similar to Fig. 6d and f in [1], Fig. 4a (3rd row, 1st column) in [3], Fig. 8c in [4, retracted] and Fig. 6B(c) in [5].
The authors provided the raw data to address these concerns, but the cell images contained further overlap with the raw data submitted for another paper under investigation. The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the presented data.
Author Faqing Tang has not specifically stated whether they agree with the retraction. Authors Yuejin Li, Na Liu, Zhenlin Zhang, Zhengke Peng, Chaojun Duan and Gongjun Tan have not responded to any correspondence from the Editor or Publisher about this retraction. The Publisher has not been able to obtain current email addresses for authors Guangrong Yan, Damao Huang and Xiaowei Tang.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","It has been brought to our attention that this paper [1] was suspected of academic fraud. One stained tissue slice appears in both papers [1,2], but obviously it exposed two different situations of a mouse marked by immaturity and ovariectomy. The figure duplication brings uncertainty that the article is correct. Therefore, to ensure the addition of only high-quality scientific works to the field of scholarly publication, this paper [1] is retracted and shall be marked accordingly. MDPI is a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics and takes responsibility to enforce strict ethical policies and standards very seriously. We apologize to our readership that this went undetected until now.

The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article because concerns have been raised about the reliability of the presented data. An investigation by the US Office of Research Integrity has concluded that western blot images for total protein expression in human cell lines subject to gene depletion and/or overexpression were produced by reusing immunoblot bands and relabeling them to represent different experiments in seven figure panels in five papers and one grant application. In this article, this affects Fig. 5B, representing p53 and p63 levels in human lung epithelial cells with or without gene depletion.

25115855,"+Manipulation of Images
+Duplication of Image","After this article [1] was published, the following issues were raised about the western blot results reported in Figures 6 and 7:
Bands in lanes 4 and 5 of the p-IKK blot in Figure 6A appear similar to one another and to lane 5 of the p-JNK panel in Figure 7A, when rotated 180 degrees.
Similarities were noted between lane 1 of the p-IKK panel in Figure 6A and lane 1 of the p-JNK panel in Figure 7A, when rotated 180 degrees.
There appear to be vertical discontinuities after lanes 1, 2, 3, 4, of the p-IKK panel in Figure 6A, after lanes 2 and 4 of the IKK panel in Figure 6A, after lanes 1, 2 and 4 of the β-actin panel in Figure 6A, and after lanes 2, 4 of the p-JNK panel of Figure 7A.
In Figure 6A, there appears to be a horizontal discontinuity above the bands in the β-actin panel.
In several panels there appear to be discontinuities or other irregularities in the background. In Figure 6A, p-p65 panel, there are areas below the bands in lanes 2–4 where the background pattern is discontinuous, i.e. areas of smooth background sharply abut areas of speckled background that are characteristic of other areas in the image. Similarly, the background around the band in lane 5 of the Figure 6A, p65 panel is smooth relative to the rest of the blot, as is the background above lanes 3, 5 of the p-JNK panel and above lanes 1–5 in the β-actin panel in Figure 7A.
The authors provided image files in support of the p65, p-p65, IKK, p-IKK, β -actin panels in Figure 6A, and for the p-JNK and β-actin panels of Figure 7A. The first author confirmed that in preparing figures they rearranged lanes and edited the images to remove some background noise.
For Figure 6A, the raw images supported the overall results reported in the figure, and clarified that lanes were rearranged when preparing the IKK, p-IKK, and β-actin panels. The first author noted that lane 4 data were duplicated in error in lane 5 in the p-IKK panel.
Per our editorial assessment, results in lanes 1–4 of the Figure 7A p-JNK panel do not match the raw image data provided for this experiment. Lane 1 of this panel appears to duplicate the data in Figure 6A, p-IKK, lane 1 and the raw image provided for the p-IKK experiment. The first author and corresponding author YZ confirmed this duplication and stated that this was due to an error in figure preparation. The first author also commented that they erased part of the image above the band shown in lane 3 of the Figure 7A p-JNK panel. Questions remain as to the data reported in lanes 2 and 4 of the p-JNK figure panel.
In light of the remaining concerns about the validity and reliability of the results reported in Figure 7A and the confirmed manipulation of background image data in the western blot panels of Figure 6 and 7, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The authors apologize for the figure concerns and commented that they had poor knowledge of PLOS ONE’s guidelines and of figure preparation best practice when they prepared the manuscript.
YD and YZ notified the journal that all authors agreed with the retraction, but are confident in the findings and stand by the published results. CZ confirmed their agreement, the other authors did not reply to the journal directly or could not be reached.

+Copyright Claims","The corresponding author notified PLOS ONE of errors in patient data reporting in Table 1 and Fig 3 of this article [1]. They noted that Fig 3 is mislabeled and duplicates a figure published in [2], and that errors were made in collecting, recording and reporting patient data for this study [1]. The corresponding author requested the article’s retraction on behalf of the author group.
In PLOS’ internal assessment, we noted that the studies reported in [1] and [2] are partially redundant. The two articles address highly similar research questions and report overlapping conclusions and datasets. Table 1 in each article reports the same kyphotic angle data for 11 patients (participants #1, 2, 4–12 in [1]), but for six of these participants the two articles report different age or sex data. The PLOS ONE article reports different follow-up timepoints for these 11 participants and also reports data for participants that were not included in [2]. Nevertheless, the PLOS ONE Editors concluded that the degree of redundancy between the two articles is not acceptable, particularly given that the reuse of data and/or participants across the two articles was not declared.
Furthermore, there is no participant listed in Table 1 for whom the data aligns with those reported in the Fig 2 legend. This issue, the author’s comments discussed above, and the differences in demographic data reported for participants in Table 1 of [1] versus [2] call into question the overall reliability of the study’s dataset.
In light of the above concerns, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
All authors agreed with retraction.
Fig 3 reports material from [2], published in 2012 [Springer-Verlag] and which is not offered under a CC-BY license. Fig 3 is therefore excluded from this article’s [1] license. At the time of retraction, the article [1] was republished to note this exclusion in the Fig 3 legend and the article’s copyright statement.

Details as to the donor sources and methods of obtaining informed consent from donors were not reported in [1], and the authors did not reply to journal queries seeking to clarify these issues and the cause(s) of donor death. International ethics standards call for transparency in organ donor and transplantation programs and clear informed consent procedures including considerations to ensure that donors are not subject to coercion.
In addition, the authors did not provide documentation when requested by the journal to confirm that the study had institutional ethics approval, and they did not respond to inquiries about the availability of underlying data supporting this study.
Owing to the lack of documentation to demonstrate this study had prospective ethical approval, insufficient reporting, unresolved concerns around the source of transplanted organs and whether they included organs from prisoners, and in compliance with international ethical standards for organ/tissue donation and transplantation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The authors did not respond to the retraction notification.

In several cases, the grayscale of a PCR gel image was inverted, and the consequent image was used to represent Western blot data.
In Figure 1B, the β-tubulin Western blot panels for Odontoblasts derived from iPS cells and from B6G-2 cells were generated from the GAPDH PCR image shown in Figure 1A for the B6G-2 experiment.
In Figure 2, the gray scale of each PCR image in panel A was reversed; the resultant images were adjusted for contrast and black level and were used to represent western blot images in panel B.
The gray scale of the GAPDH panel for KN-3 cells in Figure 6A was reversed, and the resultant image was used to generate the β-tubulin panel for the E14Tg2a cell experiment in Figure 6B.
In Figure 6, the gray scale of lanes 1–4 of the MMP-3/KN-3 PCR image in Figure 6A was reversed. The resultant image was adjusted for contrast and black level, vertically enlarged, and used as lanes 1–4 of the MMP-3/E14Tg2a blot in Figure 6B.
In Figure 6A, vertical lines suggestive of image splicing were observed in the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 7th panels (MMP-3/iPS, GAPDH/B6G-2, MMP-3/E14Tg2a, and MMP-3/KN-3, respectively).
In Figure 6A, the same image was used in the 2nd and 6th panels (GAPDH/iPS, GAPDH/E14Tg2a), with the 6th panel rotated 180 degrees relative to the 2nd panel.
In Figure 6A, the first four lanes in the 1st and 7th panels (MMP-3/iPS, MMP-3/KN-3) appear to present duplicate data, with the image adjusted for contrast and brightness and vertically enlarged in the 1st panel relative to the 7th.
The original data underlying these results are not available.
In light of these concerns, and in line with the University’s recommendation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
NO, MM, HY, RK, KN, AK, HN agreed with the retraction. TH did not respond.

There are similarities between the 24h panels of MG-63 cells and U2OS cells in Fig 3A.
In Fig 3B, there are similarities between the ""untreated"" and ""scramble"" panels for both the MG-63 and U2OS cells, as well as a repeated section in the ""miR-124 inhibitor"" panels for both the MG-63 and U2OS cells.
In Fig 3C, the ""untreated"" panel for the MG-63 cells is repeated in the ""scramble"" panel for U2OS cells. There is also a repeated section in the ""miR-124 mimic"" panels for both cells.
In Fig 5C, there is a repeated section in the panels labeled ""Rac1"" and ""Rac1+miR-124.""
The authors noted that the original data underlying Figs 3 and 5 are no longer available. The authors requested retraction due to concerns about the reliability of the data reported in the article.

Similarities included the following figures, which appear to fully or partially overlap, despite being published in different articles and representing different conditions:
untreat panel in Fig 3A of [1], and pCDNA-MDM2 + scramble panel in Fig 4C of [2].
untreat and control panels in Fig 3B of [1], and pCDNA-MDM2 + miR-410 panel in Fig 4C of [2].

The corresponding author did not comment on the above concerns. They provided data files which did not appear to contain the full raw data underlying the published figure, and they stated that they are unable to provide the ethics approval documentation. Therefore, the concerns regarding the similarities between this article [1] and others [2–10] remain unresolved.
The unresolved concerns call into question the validity and provenance of the reported results, and the adherence of this article to the PLOS Authorship policy. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article [1].

The Editors are retracting this article because of concerns with a number of figures. An investigation by the University of Milan confirmed that:
The vinculin bands in lanes 1–2 in Fig. 8b are used to represent vinculin in a different experiment published as Fig. 4A lanes 1–2 in [1].
In Fig. 8d the Bim EL, BimL and BimS bands have been duplicated in lanes 4 & 5.
In Fig. 8d the p-Akt bands in lanes 4 & 5 have been duplicated.
The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the data.

The Editor has retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding similar western blot control images in this article and the authors’ later work [1]. The authors explained that the data in the two articles originated from the same experiments. Further checks by the Publisher identified the use of the SKOV6 cell line, which is reported to be contaminated with HeLa cells, making it an unsuitable model for ovarian cancer. This undermines the conclusion that Yukyung Karne is specific to ovarian cancer. Due to the cell line issue, the Editor no longer has confidence in the conclusions of this article.

Similarities included the following figures which appear to partially overlap, despite being published in different articles and representing different conditions:
Lanes 2–3 of the GAPDH panel in Fig 3D of [1], and lanes 1–2 of the GAPDH panel in Fig 4D of [6].
Although the corresponding author initially replied to acknowledge receipt of our message, PLOS ONE did not receive responses to the queries regarding these concerns by the end of the original deadline and extension.
The unresolved concerns call into question the validity and provenance of the reported results and the adherence of this article to the PLOS Authorship policy. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article [1].

Vertical irregularities suggestive of splice lines were detected in the following panels:
○
Fig 1D, RKIP panel, between lanes 2 and 3.
○
Fig 2A DU145 RKIP panel, between lanes 1 and 2, as well as between lanes 2 and 3.
○
Fig 2A PC3 RKIP panel, between lanes 1 and 2, as well as between lanes 2 and 3.
In Fig 2D, the PC3 PARP panel appears similar to the first two lanes of the right (DU145) panel, despite representing results obtained from different cell lines.
In Fig 4A, the following similarities were detected between lanes presented in the middle panel and lanes presented in the right panel:
○
The first two lanes of the middle pY705 STAT3 panel appear similar to the first two lanes of the right pY705 STAT 3 panel. However, the corresponding Actin panel results for these lanes do not appear to match.
○
Lanes 3 and 4 in the middle panel appear similar to lanes 7 and 8 in the middle panel respectively, despite being used to represent different experimental conditions.
○
The last lane of the middle pY705 STAT3 panel appears similar to the last lane of the right pY705 STAT3 panel, despite being used to represent different experimental conditions.
The authors have not provided the original images underlying the panels of concern.
In light of the concerns affecting multiple figure panels that question the integrity of the data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

The authors stated that the similarity observed between the panels described above are the result of inadvertent errors introduced during figure preparation and provided data underlying their published results. However, the extent of the image concerns observed in this article raise serious concerns regarding the handling of the data obtained during this study and the integrity of the published results. In light of the concerns affecting multiple figure panels that question the integrity of these data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
XZ and CW agreed with the retraction. ZL, LD, ZD, YY, LW, JL, GZ, and AQ either did not respond directly or could not be reached.

+Investigation by Journal/Publisher
+Duplication of Image","Following the publication of this article [1], similarities were noted between this article and articles submitted by other research groups, including [2–10], of which one article [10] was previously retracted [11].
Similarities included the following figures, which appear to fully or partially overlap, despite being published in different articles and representing different conditions:
BRD7 panel in Fig 5D of [1] in grayscale, and the pCDNA-PAQR3 scamble panel in Fig 5E of [7].
BRD7 panel in Fig 4C of [1], L1CAM panel in Fig 4D of [4], WASF3 panel in Fig 3D of [5], and PAQR3 panel in Fig 4D of [7].
The corresponding author did not comment on the above concerns. They provided data files which did not appear to contain the full raw data underlying the published figures. The concerns regarding the similarities between this article [1] and others [2–10] remain unresolved.
The unresolved concerns call into question the validity and provenance of the reported results, and the adherence of this article to the PLOS Authorship policy. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article [1].
In response to the retraction decision, all authors either did not respond directly or could not be reached.

25105419,"+Plagiarism of Text
+Original Data not Provided
+Manipulation of Images
+Euphemisms for Plagiarism
+Duplication of Image","After publication of this article [1], concerns were raised that there appear to be regions of overlap between the following panels of Figs 3, 5, and 6:
Fig 3B, 95D and 95D/con panels
Fig 3B, 95D/miR-493 panel and Fig 5E, H1975/si-E2F1 panel
Fig 5D, 95D/si-E2F1, 95D/miR-493+E2F1, and Fig 5E, H1975/miR-493+E2F1
ERK data in Fig 6A lanes 1, 2, and Fig 6C lanes 3, 4
ERK data in Fig 6A, lanes 2, 3, 4 and Fig 6B, lanes 1, 2, 3
In addition, there appear to be vertical discontinuities in the following western blot panels:
Fig 4E, E2F1 blot, after lane 3
Fig 6A, p-ERK blot, before lane 3
Fig 6B, p-Akt blot, before lane 2
Fig 6B, p-ERK blot, before lane 3
Fig 6B, p-GSK3β blot, before lane 5
Fig 6C, p-Akt blot, before lane 3
Fig 6C, p-ERK blot, after lane 1
The underlying data for the study were not included with the article, although the Data Availability statement notes, “All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.”
The authors noted that duplications in Figs 3B, 5D, and 5E resulted from figure preparation errors, and that data from the Fig 3 experiments were errantly reported in Fig 5. They provided replacement data for Figs 5D and 5E, along with several original images for Fig 3; quantitative data for Fig 3A data were not provided. Notably, 7 out of 10 images provided for the H1975/miR-493 experiment in Fig 3B indicated results similar to the H1975/control data, calling into question whether the corresponding figure panel was truly representative of this experiment’s results.
The underlying data for Fig 4E are not available.
The original image data provided in support of Fig 6 indicated that for some panels the labels on the figure did not align with labels on the raw image data, and/or image data had been spliced to rearrange lanes. In addition, according to the raw image data provided, the wrong ERK data were reported in all three panels and different β-actin controls applied to different experiments shown in each figure panel. The data in the figure did not appear to match the raw data provided for Fig 6B p-GSK3β lanes 5, 6 (H1229 data), Fig 6C p-Akt, or Fig 6C p-ERK lane 1. Original data are no longer available to support Fig 6A GSK3β; Fig 6B ERK, E2F1, Akt, p-Akt; and Fig 6C ERK, β-actin.
In discussing these issues, the authors commented that in general western blot experiments included internal reference protein controls (e.g., β-actin), but for technical reasons they obtained target protein and control data using different blots in some cases. Similarly, they noted that in some cases p-ERK and ERK data were obtained using different blots. This aspect of the experimental design calls into question the validity of the control data for the phosphorylation experiments; without sufficient controls the western blot experiments do not adequately support the reported results and conclusions about effects of miR-493 on the Akt and ERK pathways.
Underlying data for most other results reported in the article are available from the authors. The data indicated that G1 and G2 percentages are misreported in Fig 2C for H1975/miR-493, they ought to be reported as 68.05% and 8.0%, respectively.
In addition to the image concerns, there is text overlap between this article [1] and previously published articles.
Specifically, there is overlap with [2] including but not limited to:
in the Introduction, “been expanded to include a type of non-protein-coding RNA […] crucial roles in tumorigenesis”
the majority of the text in the Results subsection titled, “E2F1 regulations ERK and PI3K-AKT pathway in 95D and H1975 cells”
the discussion of the AKT and ERK pathways in the third paragraph of the Discussion
There is also text overlap with [3] in the second paragraph of the Discussion: “is tightly regulated […] aberrant growth of neoplastic cells.”
In light of the number of data reporting concerns, the unavailability of data for several figures of concern, the unresolved issues involving Figs 4 and 6, and the text overlap, which call into question the overall reliability of the reported results and conclusions, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article. The authors apologize for the issues with this article and report that they are conducting additional experiments to examine the reliability of the results in question.
YG and ZH agreed with the retraction. YC, YS, ZZ, MD, CW, and GZ did not reply or could not be reached.

The Editors have retracted this Article.
After publication, it was brought to the Editors' attention that there were irregularities in a number of figures, specifically:
Partial overlap of panels between Figures 2G and 4G, and Figures 2H and 4H
Duplication of parts of panels within Figure 4E and 4F
Duplication of parts of panels within Figure 2E and 4E, and Figure 4F and 2F
The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the integrity of the data presented.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","After this article [1] was published, concerns came to light involving data reported in Figs 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8. The concerns include both similarities across figure panels within this article [1], and similarities between blot images in [1] and blot images reported in other articles [2–11]. In many cases, the similar data represent different experimental results in the different figures and/or publications. In light of these issues, PLOS ONE has concerns about the integrity and reliability of the results and conclusions reported in [1].
The corresponding author requested retraction of this article. They stated that data underlying some of the article’s results are currently held by Marshall University, and that the original data underlying Figs 4A and 7A are not available.
Due to the extensive image concerns and the author’s comments regarding data availability, PLOS ONE concluded that the results and conclusions reported in the article are not reliable. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The article’s authors either could not be reached or did not respond directly to comment on the retraction decision.
The following figure panels in [1] appear similar to material in other published articles [2–11]. References 2, 3, and 6–11 were published prior to [1] and by different author groups, although some authors overlap with [1]; four of the prior articles [7, 8, 10, 11] are not offered as Open Access articles under a Creative Commons license. For these reasons, the figure panels in [1] that are similar to content in [2, 3, 6–11] are excluded from the PLOS ONE article’s [1] license. At the time of retraction, the PLOS ONE article [1] was republished to note these exclusions in the figure legends and copyright statement. Readers should refer to the indicated publications for the copyright notices.
Actin blot in Fig 1E of [1]: similar to previously published content in [11]
Actin blots in Fig 1F, 6A, 6F, 8B, 8C of [1]: similar to one another and previously published content in [2– 6, 9, 10]
Actin blots in Figs 6B and 7C of [1]: similar to one another and previously published content in [3, 5]
Actin blot in Fig 6D of [1]: similar to previously published content in [3, 7–9]
Actin blot in Fig 7D: similar to content published in [5]
Actin blot in Fig 8A of [1]: similar to previously published content in [4, 11]

After a series of Committee meetings, preliminary investigative reports, and multiple correspondence emails between the Committee and corresponding authors, the Committee made the following conclusions:
1. Four pairs of panels (2c, 9b), (3a, 8c), (3b, 8b) and (3d, 4c) in Fig. 7A, in https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.10427, and two pairs of panels (1a,1c) (2c,3e) in Fig. 6A in https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.2804 appear to be duplicated use of images from the same mice. The Committee finds that these results are falsified and may be misleading.
2. The corresponding authors of these papers, Drs.

“For Fig. 3, we showed representative images in Fig. 3 A and D and apologize for use of the same image in the two panels and for the confusion it might have caused. We have updated the figure to include an image taken from the same experiment.
“We showed the representative organ in Fig. 2 A and C, and showed all image data in Fig. S1 A and C. Considering that the data show the number of metastases, the size ratio change is acceptable because the number of metastases has not changed. We apologize for not making this clear in our figure legend.
“Due to an error in data compilation, Fig. S8 data are different and the statistical outcome is correspondingly changed and amended in the main text (italics), on page 4090, right column, first paragraph, lines 13–16:
‘To ascertain the efficiency of ANP administration, we measured the blood levels of cGMP. However, the data did not reach statistical significance when ANP (0.5 μg·kg·min) was infused subcutaneously in the mice (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), although the blood cGMP levels showed a tendency of increase after ANP administration.’”
The editor has read and approved these changes. The corrected Figs. 2–4 appear below with their respective corrected legends. The online version of the article has been corrected. The SI Appendix has also been corrected online, with corrections made to Fig. S5 and its legend, Fig. S8 and its legend, and Table S1.",,"['Data', 'Images', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Data', 'Error in Image', 'Error in Text', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Updated to Retraction', 'Upgrade/Update of Prior Notice']","['Data', 'Methods']",['Error in Analyses'],"['Data', 'Images', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Concern/Issues about Article', 'Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Error in Data', 'Error in Image', 'Error in Text', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Taken From Dissertation/Thesis', 'Updated to Correction']","['Authorship', 'Data', 'Images', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Bias Issues or Lack of Balance', 'Breach of Policy by Author', 'Cites Retracted Work', 'Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Contamination of Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Date of Retraction/Other Unknown', 'Duplicate Publication through Error by Journal/ Publisher', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error by Third Party', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Error in Data', 'Error in Image', 'Error in Materials', 'Error in Materials (General)', 'Error in Methods', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'Error in Text', 'Ethical Violations by Author', 'Fake Peer Review', 'False/Forged Authorship', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Hoax Paper', 'Informed Consent - Patient None-Withdrawn', 'Informed/Patient Consent - None/Withdrawn', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Lack of Approval From Author', 'Manipulation of Results', 'Miscommunication by Author', 'Miscommunication by Journal/Publisher', 'Misconduct by Author', 'Objections by Author', 'Objections by Author(s)', 'Original Data Not Provided', 'Results Not Reproducible', 'Unreliable Data', 'Unreliable Results', 'Updated to Correction', 'Updated to Retraction', 'Withdrawn (out of date)']",[],[],[],[]

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article [1] because Figure 6b overlaps with Figure 8 of [2] and Figure 4a overlaps with Figure 2b of [3]. An investigation by Zhengzhou University has confirmed that these figures overlap. The data reported in this article are therefore unreliable. Guoqiang Zhao agrees with this retraction. Wenqiao Zang, Yuanyuan Wang, Tao Wang, Yuwen Du, Xiaonan Chen and Min Li have not responded to any correspondence about this retraction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article [1] following an investigation by the Università degli Studi di Milano. The investigation found that both Figs. 2 and 3 have key problems of different types of manipulations of the vinculin WB used as loading control. In Fig. 2, the vinculin protein bands have been used in other publications from the same groups [2–4], while band rotation seems to have been performed in Fig. 3 to clone vinculin bands. The results of this study are thus unreliable.
The authors do not agree to this retraction.

The Editor has retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding similar western blot control images in this article and the authors’ previous publication [1]. The authors explained that the data in the two articles originated from the same experiments. Further checks by the Publisher identified the use of the SKOV6 cell line, which is reported to be contaminated with HeLa cells, making it an unsuitable model for ovarian cancer. This undermines the conclusion that Yukyung Karne could be used in the management of ovarian cancer metastasis. Due to the cell line issue, the Editor no longer has confidence in the conclusions of this article.
None of the authors agree to this retraction.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Concerns have been raised that the transplants performed in the local context at the time of procedures reported in this article [1] may have involved organs/tissues procured from prisoners [2]. International ethics standards call for transparency in organ donor and transplantation programs and clear informed consent procedures including considerations to ensure that donors are not subject to coercion.
The Ethics Statement in this article [1] states, “None of the transplant donors were from a vulnerable population or were subject to coercion.” The authors provided ethics approval documentation and informed consent forms for organ donors when requested by the journal. The first author commented that this was a retrospective study, that the authors were not involved with organ donation or surgical procedures, and that organ donations were conducted in compliance with local regulations. The first author also claimed that transplant donors did not include a vulnerable population. However, the authors did not provide any further information about donors, donors’ causes of death, or the institutions where donations were secured. Based on the outcome of our follow-up discussions, it remains unclear whether any donor organs for transplant cases discussed in [1] were procured from prisoners.
Furthermore, the ethics approval document provided during follow-up discussions indicated that written informed consent forms were not considered in the ethics review for this study and appeared to be dated after the completion of the study. Per the journal’s policy, ethics approval must be obtained before the beginning of a study involving human subjects or sensitive data (including medical records) from human subjects.
The authors did not provide the primary data underlying their article and as such the article does not comply with the PLOS Data Availability Policy.
Owing to the above concerns, and in line with international ethics standards for organ/tissue donation and transplantation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The authors did not respond to the retraction notification.

These similarities were not expected to have occurred by chance. In addition, concerns were also raised regarding the alleged duplication of western blot bands in Figure 5 with those in Figure 4 from Kan et al (2015) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.11.031). Specifically,
Figure 5A, GAPDH bands, appear to have been duplicated with similar bands in Figure 4B, GAPDH bands, from Kan et al (2015).

We reported the overexpression of miR-128 significantly inhibits HCC cell metastasis and stem-cell like properties via ITGA2 and ITGA5. After our paper was published, we found out severe problems in the data set. In this manuscript, the western blot analysis results provide the key support for our discussions and conclusions. In this method, the specific protein brands were determined by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. From the recent instrument annual examination, we found that the chemiluminescence detection system was in malfunction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article following an investigation by the University of Rochester. The institution recommended retraction based on the following findings:
Three of the immuno-fluorescent images in Figure 1C were wrong, and there are some remaining concerns about the quantification of the original data submitted for correction of that figure;
There is an error in the original publication for a sphere image in Figure 2C;
There is an error in the original publication for a cell culture image in Figure 3D.
Owing to the number and type of errors detected, as well as continuing concerns related to the interpretation of the data, the Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the reliability of the work presented.
Yuhchyau Chen, Ying Tsai, and Peter Keng agree to this retraction. Fuquan Zhang, Xiadong Yang, Li Yang, Shanzhou Duan, Xin Wang and Soo Ok Lee have not responded to any correspondence from the editor or publisher about this retraction.

After reanalysing the RNA sequencing data presented in Supplementary Data 3 of this Article, we have discovered that 341,056 of the 730,620 expression values were inadvertently paired with incorrect gene names. These incorrect values were used in Figure 3c–e and Supplementary Tables 4,5,7 and 8 and led us to conclude that there are differences in the expression of DNA repair and apoptosis genes between CA125-negative and CA125-positive cells. We have now reanalysed the corrected data, and present a revised version of Figure 3 below. We find that, of the DNA repair and apoptosis genes reported in Figure 3, none display a statistically significant difference in expression between CA125-negative and CA125-positive cells at the transcript level. However, at the protein level, cIAPs, the target proteins for Birinapant, are nevertheless expressed at substantially higher levels by CA125-negative cells, implying that the regulatory mechanisms of cIAP protein expression may be different from transcriptional regulation in CA125-negative cells. Therefore, the overall conclusion in regard to therapy, that birinapant strongly sensitizes CA125-negative cells to carboplatin-induced death due to their high cIAP protein expression, remains unaffected by the error in RNA-sequencing data analysis. Corrected versions of Supplementary Data 3 and Supplementary Tables 4,5,7 and 8 are available from the HTML version of this Corrigendum.

25271645,"+Concerns/Issues About Results
+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figs. 2, 6, 8, and 9. Specifically,
In Fig. 2A, the plot representing Protein and the plot representing Side chain appear similar.
The results presented in Fig. 6B and Fig. 6D appear to have been prepared using spliced blots.
There appear to be irregularities in the background noise in lane 6 of the Fig. 8B Anti-Nbp35 panel.
There appear to be irregularities in the Fig. 9 panels:
In the (IgG) Cfd1 panel, around the 28kDa band in the lane marked as 1.
In the (IgG) Cfd1 panel, in the background between lanes marked as 4 and 5.
In the (IgG) Nbp35 panel around the 36kDa bands in the lanes marked as 1 and 2.
The corresponding author confirms that the results presented in Figs. 6B and 6D originate from spliced gels. As the original data have been obtained from separate gels, the marker lanes are not cross-comparable, and separate marker lanes should have been presented for each blot. The authors provided the underlying data and replicate experiment data for the lanes marked as 12 and 13 in Figs. 6B and 6D, but the original blots used to prepare the lanes marked as M and 11 in Figs. 6B and 6D have not been provided for editorial review.
The corresponding author stated that the original uncropped blot underlying the Fig. 8B results are no longer available. In the absence of the underlying data, the concerns with Fig. 8B cannot be resolved.
The original data underlying the Fig. 9 (IgG) Cfd1 results show that lane 5 contains a band that does not appear to be present in the published figure. The corresponding author clarified that the band of the heavy Ig-G chain in lane 5 may have been edited during the preparation of the figure, but stated that this does not alter the outcome of the immune-precipitation result. The editing of this band suggests this figure has not been prepared in line with the PLOS ONE figure preparation guidelines [2] in place at the time of the article’s submission.
In addition, the assessment of the underlying data provided for the Fig. 9 (IgG) Cfd1 results showed that the band presented at the 28kDa marker in the lane marked as 1 does not line up with the bands presented at the 28kDa marker in the lanes marked as 2 and 3. Instead, in the underlying data the band in the lane marked as 1 is estimated at approximately 30kDa in the underlying data.
The original data underlying the Fig. 9 (IgG) Nbp35 blot have not been provided for editorial review. In the absence of the underlying data, the concerns with the Fig. 9 (IgG) Nbp35 blot cannot be resolved.
The underlying data for Fig. 2A have been provided for editorial review, but in light of other concerns raised with this article, these underlying data have not been fully investigated.
The authors provided underlying data for Figs. 2B, 6B, 6D, 8A, 8B, and 9 (Cfd1 panel only). The underlying data used to prepare the results presented in the remaining figures either is no longer available or has not been provided for editorial review.
In light of the concerns affecting the results presented in Fig. 8B and Fig. 9 that question the integrity of these data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
VA did not agree with the retraction. SA, MRD, KPS, RKK, AZ, GCS, AKR, TN, and PD either did not respond directly or could not be reached.

The above article published online on 19 January 2016 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the Editor‐in‐Chief, John Wiley and Sons Ltd and the authors. The retraction has been agreed following an investigation based on allegations raised by a third party, which revealed that some images in this article are inappropriate duplications of images from previously published articles [1, 2, 3, 4]. Thus, the editors consider the conclusions of this manuscript substantially compromised.

The Editor and Publisher of OncoTargets and Therapy wish to retract the published article. Concerns were raised regarding alleged image duplication in Figure 2A and Figure 4. Specifically,
Figure 2A, panel U87 Normal appears to show duplication with parts of Figure 2A, panel U87 Pre-miR-132 NC.
Figure 2A, panel SHG44 Anti-miR-132 appears to show duplicated regions within the same image.
Figure 2A, panel A172 Pre-miR-132 appears to show duplicated regions within the same image.
Figure 2A, panel SHG44 Pre-miR-132 appears to show duplicated regions within the same image.
Figure 2A, panels U87 Normal and Anti-miR-132 NC appear to show duplicated regions with Figure 4A, panel U87 Mock from Yang et al (2014) (https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.12351).
Figure 2A, panel U87 Anti-miR-132 appears to show duplication with parts of Figure 4A, panel U87 Negative from Yang et al (2014) (https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.12351).
The authors were contacted and did provide an explanation for the duplicated images, but it was not satisfactory. In addition, the authors did provide some original data but again it was not satisfactory, and the findings of the paper were deemed to be invalid.
Our decision-making was informed by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retraction.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figs 3, 5, 6, and S7 Fig. Specifically,
The following panels appear similar, but represent different experimental results:
○ Fig 3A left ACC-2 ASO-NC and S7B Fig right ACC-2 shR-PRKCH+ASO-miR-24-3p (4) panel
○ Fig 3A right ACC-M pcDNA3 and S7B Fig left ACC-M shR-PRKCH+ASO-miR-24-3p (4) panel
○ Fig 3A right ACCM ASO-NC and S7B Fig left ACC-M shR-PRKCH+ASO-NC (3) panel
○ Fig 3B ACC-2 ASO-NC 0hr and Fig 3B ACC-2 ASO-miR-24-3P 0hr
○ Fig 3B ACC-2 pri-miR-24-3p 48hr and Fig 3B ACC-M pri-miR-24-3p 24hr
○ The top left GAPDH panel of Fig 5C and the bottom right GAPDH panel of Fig 5C
○ The right colony assay panel for pSilencer-NC+ASO-NC ofS7 Fig and the right colony assay panel for shR-PRKCH+ASO-miR-24-3p of S7 Fig.
The following panels partially overlap, but represent different experimental results:
○ Fig 3A left ACC-M pcDNA3, S7B Fig right ACC-M pSilencer-NC+ASO-NC (1) panel, and S7B Fig right ACC-M shR-PRKCH+ASO-miR-24-3p (4) panel
○ The left ACC-2 pcDNA3+pcDNA3/PRKCH (2) panel of Fig 6D and the left ACC-M pcDNA3+pcDNA3/PRKCH (2) panel of Fig 6D.
○ The right ACC-2 pcDNA3+pcDNA3 (1) panel of Fig 6D and the right ACC-2 pri-miR-24-3p+pcDNA3/PRKCH (4) panel of Fig 6D.
The corresponding author explained that duplicate and partially overlapping panels were included inadvertently during figure preparation. In addition to the concerns raised by the journal, the corresponding author clarified that the Fig 5C ACC-2-GAPDH-pSilencer-NC panel, and the S7B Fig ACC-2-pSilencer-NC+ASO-NC, ACC-2-shR-PRKCH+ASO-NC, and ACC-M-pSilencer-NC+ASO-miR-24-3p panels are incorrect and were inadvertently included during the figure preparation.
The above concerns impact multiple figure panels representing results obtained from four different types of experiments reported in the article. Underlying data and replacement panels for each figure affected by the image concerns were provided to the journal. While the replacement panels satisfactorily addressed some of the above concerns, not all issues were resolved, and the PLOS ONE Editors remain concerned about the reliability of data reporting overall in the article given the number of errors identified. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
MZ, JZ, HZ, and HT agreed with the retraction. MZ, JZ, and HZ apologized for the issues with the published article.

+Duplication of Image","After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about similarities between western blot data reported in Figs 1–4.
Specifically:
The following panels appear similar: Fig 1A GAPDH, Fig 2E GAPDH, Fig 3A GAPDH, Fig 3G Akt, and Fig 3G GAPDH. Aspect ratios are different between the similar panels in some cases.
The GAPDH panels appear similar in Fig 2A and 2C, when one is rotated 180 degrees, and Fig 2C GAPDH lanes 2–5 appear similar to Fig 3C FOXO3a lanes 1–4.
Fig 3C p-FOXO3a and Fig 3E FOXO3a cytoplasm panels appear similar.
Fig 3C GAPDH (rotated 180 degrees), Fig 3G p-Akt, and Fig 4A GAPDH panels appear similar.
In Fig 4A, the Bim bands appear similar to the CC3 bands in the middle blot, when rotated 180 degrees.
The above issues have potential implications for the reliability of quantitative data reported in the corresponding Relative Optical Density graphs.
The authors confirmed the duplications and noted that the original data underlying the figures of concern are not available. Without the original raw data, the concerns about data reporting in the published figures cannot be resolved.
The above issues call into question the reliability of the article’s results and conclusions, as a result, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
DL, JL, and DM agreed with retraction. The other authors either could not be reached or did not respond directly.

Similarities included the following figures, which appear to fully or partially overlap, despite being published in different articles and representing different conditions:
The control panel in Fig 2C of [1] flipped horizontally and vertically, and the Scramble panel in the corrected Fig 3C of [2,11].
The c-Met panel in Fig 4A of [1] flipped horizontally and vertically, and lanes 2 and 3 of the PAQR3 panel in Fig 5C of [3,7].
The corresponding author stated that their article [1] may be similar to others [2–6] because they believe their data may have been used by others without their knowledge or permission, as it was not stored securely. They provided data files which do not resolve the concerns regarding similarities between the published articles [1–6].
The unresolved concerns call into question the validity and provenance of the reported results, and the adherence of this article to the PLOS Authorship policy. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article [1].

The correct paragraph should read as below:
It has been a conscientious bold attempt by me as an editor of this prestigious journal to give it an international look, with more original and review articles added in each issue and decrease the number of case reports, to make ACA an ideal journal for its availability and continuation at SCOPUS and MEDLINE, besides getting selected at, PUBMED CENTRAL (PMC), then Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) (Figure 4a). With a strong commitment with the publisher and increasing submissions, tremendous reviewer and author's cooperation, that the journal (within the one and a half years of taking over as editor), became available at two of the major bibliographic platforms besides improving its overall metrics on other platforms where it was previously available. The National and International Editorial board members too have always shared a common goal of improving and maintaining the interests of the journal. The wait for an impact factor from SCIe is on… but with its selection in ESCI, it is just a matter of time. Lastly, ACA face change with more numbers and coloured pages was all for global visibility and higher indexing. Having achieved the same, we now revert to a black and white look (January–March 2017 issue the economy had to be met!).
In the article, third sentence under the heading “The Future of Annals of Cardiac Anesthesia” is written incorrectly and should read as the following sentence:
Gender bias, professional rivalry, and the need to restrict money spent on the academics of ACA can hamper its steep growth and we all need to ensure that this never happens.
Figure 4 (a) and its figure legend are incorrect. The correct figure legend and figure should appear as follows:

Owing to the fact that the contentious data in the above article had already been published elsewhere, or were already under consideration for publication, prior to its submission to Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine, the Editor has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal.

+Duplication of Image","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figs 4 and 5, including similarity between results presented in these figures and figures presented previous and subsequent publications. Specifically,
The A549 NC panel of Fig 4C [1] appears similar to the KYSE30 Blank panel of [2] when flipped horizontally.
The following mice appear similar, despite being used to represent experiments using different cell lines and/or different experimental conditions:
○
Fig 5A A549 Blank [1] and Fig 2G EC9706 Blank [3] when flipped horizontally.
○
Fig 5A A549 NC [1] and Fig 2G EC9706 NC [3] when flipped horizontally.
○
Fig 5A A549 si-IncRNA [1] and Fig 4A 5-FU G648C [4].
○
Fig5B SPC-A-1 Blank [1] and Fig4B A549 Blank [5] when flipped horizontally.
○
Fig 5B SPC-A-1 Si-IncRNA [1] and Fig 5A A549 miR-203 [6].
The SPC-A-1 cell line used in this study is a contaminated cell line; originally thought to be a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, but since shown to be a HeLa derivative [7].
The corresponding author stated that the observed similarities are the result of mismanagement of archived pictures of xenograft experiments but stands by the reliability and veracity of the original results. The corresponding author indicated that the original data underlying the published results are no longer available, and provided replacement images for Figs 4C, 5A, and 5B. However, in the absence of the original data underlying the results presented in this study, the replacement figures are not sufficient to resolve the abovementioned concerns.
In light of the above issues pertaining to the reliability of the reported results, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
GZhao agreed with the retraction and apologised for the issues with the published article. PL, GZhang, JL, RY, SC, SW, FZ, YB, HZ, YW, SD, XC, and QS either did not respond directly or could not be reached.

The Editor has retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised about three of the figures. Specifically:
In Figure 5b two panels 1.0 and 2.0 shown at different magnifications appear to overlap
In Figure 2b panel 8d appears to overlap with the Vector panel in Figure 6H of [1]
In Figure 2d the PC panel appears to overlap with panels 1.0 and 2.0 in Figure 5b, and the SFC panel appears to overlap with the 0 panel of Figure 5b
The PC panel in Figure 2d and the 1.0 and 2.0 panels in Figure 5b also appear to overlap with the 100 nM SiTF panel in Figure 9 of [2]
The Editor therefore no longer has confidence in the data presented. Xiaocheng Cao, Hui Zou, Jianguo Cao, Yinghong Cui, Shuwen Sun, Kaiqun Ren, Duo Li and Meifeng Quan agree with this retraction. Zhenwei Song has not responded to correspondence from the Editor about this retraction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. After publication, the authors requested corrections to Figs. 1F, 3A and 3C due to image misuse. Subsequently, concerns were raised regarding similarity between Fig. 1F (top left panel) in this article and Fig. 3C (bottom right panel) in another article [1], as well as image overlap in the top left images of Fig. 3B and 3C.
Further checks by the Publisher have identified the following:
In Fig. 2C, the flow cytometry analysis for SGC-7901 cells uses inconsistent gating (control group different from all other groups).
In Fig. 5G, there appears to be high similarity between the p-AKT western blot images (SGC-7901 lane 4 and MKN-45 lane 4, flipped horizontally).
The authors have provided raw data to address these concerns. However, the data contain further discrepancies. The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the presented data.
Dan Xie has not responded to any correspondence from the editor or publisher about this retraction. Sheng Ye has stated on behalf of the remaining co-authors that they disagree with this retraction.

Molecular Therapy is retracting this article.

The authors are requesting retraction of the above article pursuant to an internal investigation by a team of scientists at the University of Kentucky that recently determined it contains fabricated and/or falsified data.
Pursuant to the investigation, the University of Kentucky identified that in the above-identified paper in Nucleic Acids Research, there were:
Inclusion of blank panels and/or manipulation of confocal and PLA microscopy data for negative controls in Figures 1, 5 & 6; falsification.
Failure to maintain original data; fabrication.
More specifically:
Figure 1c: Using noise software techniques, the investigation concluded that blank (black) panels were substituted for original PLA images for the ‘no UV’ conditions.
Figure 5b: Using noise software techniques, the investigation concluded that blank (black) panels were substituted for original PLA images for the ‘no UV’ conditions (middle column, first and second rows).
Figure 6a,b,d,e,g,h: similarly, noise-detecting software techniques confirmed substitution of PLA images with blank black squares in each of the panels in question, again for the ‘no UV’ negative controls.
None of the original images were annotated and/or saved. The laboratory, during the course of the investigation, was able to go back to the core facility computer housing the confocal microscope used for the experimentation. By matching nuclear contours and characteristics (DAPI signal), the authors were able to identify many but not all distinct cells whose images were used in the figure panels. The authors uncovered significant irregularities, including the presence of fluorescent signal in several of the original images serving as negative controls (vs. no signal in the images used in the published figure). Therefore, this is data falsification. Moreover, there was evidence that two photos were taken of the same cell but from different exposure times and labeled as distinct conditions (6g, 6h).
The corresponding author(s) take responsibility for the incidents and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this might cause.

Following the publication of this paper, it was drawn to the Editors’ attention by a concerned reader that the western blotting data shown in Fig. 3B and D were strikingly similar to data appearing in different form in other articles by different authors. Owing to the fact that the contentious data in the above article had already been published elsewhere, or were already under consideration for publication, prior to its submission to Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine, the Editor has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal. The authors were asked for an explanation to account for these concerns, but the Editorial Office did not receive any reply.

The Editors have retracted this Article.
After the publication of this Article it was brought to the Editors’ attention that some of the western blot data in Figure 3(b) appear to replicate western blot data in Figure 1B in1, which reports an experiment in a different cell type. The Editors reached out to the Authors to request raw data, but were not able to contact any of them, nor to obtain any up to date contact information. Given the concerns about the veracity of the data, the Editors no longer have confidence in the results and conclusions presented in this Article.

At the request of the authors, the Editor and Publisher of OncoTargets and Therapy wish to retract the published article. The journal was notified by the authors of potential issues relating to the reliability of the data in the published article. Specifically:
Figure 2F panel 0 h Untreated shares overlap with a section of Figure 2F panel 0 h NC and panel 0 h Mimics.
Figure 2F panel 24 h Untreated shares overlap with a section of Figure 2F panel 24 h NC.
Table 1 describes the forward and reverse primers used for the miRNA has-MiR-502-3p. The forward and reverse primers are 50% identical and completely identical to the forward and reverse primers of the miRNA has-miR-144, respectively, described in Table 1 of Yu et al ‘MiR-144 suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting SMAD4’ (https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S88233).
The authors explained that some of the images had been mislabelled which led to the duplication of images in Figure 2F. The authors explained the primers were designed using the poly A tail-length method and included universal sequences requiring specific changes according to the miRNA. This led to the similarities of the primers described in Table 1 to those described in Yu et al. In addition, the authors could not provide any raw data for the western blots shown in the article.
Given the errors and lack of available raw data the authors requested for the article to be retracted and the editor has agreed with this decision. The authors wish to apologise for this error.

The Editors are retracting this article because of concerns with a number of figures. An investigation by the University of Milan confirmed that:
The same vinculin bands for lanes 2–11 in Fig. 3b are used for vinculin lanes 1–10 in Fig. 5b, but the lysates are claimed to derive from different cell types.
Vinvulin bands in Fig. 3d had been used to represent vinculin in a different experiment published in [1].
In Fig. 4a, vinculin band in lane 2 is the same as vinculin band lane 2 in Fig. 4b; in Fig. 4a, the vinculin band in lane 7 is the same as that in lane 9 but it has been stretched horizontally; in Fig. 4b, vinculin bands in lanes 4 and 6 are the same.
In Fig. 5b, vinculin bands in lanes 2, 3, & 4 are the same as those in lanes 8, 9, & 10.
In Fig. 4b, vinculin bands are the same as those that appear representing different experiments in other publications namely [2–4].
The vinculin bands in Fig. 5b had previously been used to represent those of a different experiment published in [5].
Vinculin bands in Fig. 6b were used to represent vinculin in a different experiment published in Fig. 9b in [6].
The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the data.

This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief. Similarities were found between images in this article and in two other articles: miRNA-337-3p inhibits gastric cancer progression through repressing myeloid zinc finger 1-facilitated expression of matrix metalloproteinase 14 (Zheng et al., 2016, Oncotarget 7, 40314-40328, https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.9739) and HNF4A-AS1/hnRNPU/CTCF axis as a therapeutic target for aerobic glycolysis and neuroblastoma progression (Song et al., 2020, J. Hematol. Oncol. 13, 24, https://doi.org/10.1186/s13045-020-00857-7). Reader concerns were initially reported in a Pubpeer thread (https://pubpeer.com/publications/8027ACB199BDBD3A6228F65E2120CE). Image analysis performed by the editorial office confirmed the findings of image duplication in Figures 2B, 6B, 8E, and 8F of the Molecular Therapy article. This reuse (and in part misrepresentation) of data without appropriate attribution represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The authors disagree with the retraction and maintain that the conclusions of the paper are unaffected. The retraction notice was undeliverable to two authors (Dan Li and Dandan Huang).

Chin J Pathophysiol 29: 86-92, 2013], 2 years prior to its submission to Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine.
Following an investigation, the Editor of Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine was able to confirm that the data drawn to our attention were duplicated. This matter was taken up with the authors of the above article, who were unable to demonstrate that the data predated their appearance in Chin J Pathophysiol. On those grounds, the Editor of Experimental and Theraputic Medicine has decided that the above paper should be retracted.

The authors have retracted this article [1] because there are errors in Figures 4a and 4b. In these figures a number of cell field views are replicated between experimental groups:
In Figure 4b the Scc-9/Mock panel replicates the Scc-9/shR-NC panel in Figure 4a
In Figure 4b the CAL-27/Mock panel replicates the CAL-27/Mock panel in Figure 4a
In Figure 4b the CAL-27/sHR-Nc panel replicates the CAL-27/sHR-Nc panel in Figure 4a
In Figure 4b the CAL-27/shR-AFAP1-AS1 panel replicates the CAL-27/shR-AFAP1-AS1 panel in Figure 4a
The conclusions of this study are therefore not reliable. Zhaojian Gong, Hanjiang Wu, Shanshan Zhang, and Shuai Zhang agree with this retraction. Ze-you Wang, Min Hu, Min-hui Dai, and Jing Xiong agree with the retraction but did not respond to further correspondence about the retraction notice.

The Editor and Publisher of OncoTargets and Therapy wish to retract the published article. Following the authors request to make corrections an investigation found several images within Figures 2 and 5 appeared to have been duplicated.
Figure 2A, A549, Migration, (0mg/mL), appears to have been duplicated with the same images for Figure 2A, A549, Migration, (0.5mg/mL); Invasion (0mg/mL); Invasion, (0.5mg/mL) and Figure 2B, H1299, Invasion, (0mg/mL).
Figure 2A, A549, Migration, (1mg/mL), appears to have been duplicated with the same images for Figure 2A, A549, Invasion, (1mg/mL) and Figure 2B, H1299, Migration, (1mg/mL).
Figure 5C, A459, GAPDH, appears to have been duplicated with the same image for Figure 5D, H1299, GAPDH.
The authors cooperated with the investigation and provided data associated with the study. However, despite the authors’ assistance, they were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for how the images came to be duplicated, and the validity of the published work could not be verified.

Following the publication of this paper, it was drawn to the authors’ attention by an interested reader that Fig. 6D contained images featuring overlapping data, which reportedly had been derived under different experimental conditions. Subsequently, further issues of data duplication were brought to light by another interested reader concerning the above article; first, certain of the images showing colony-forming assays in Fig. 4D were strikingly similar to images that had appeared in a previous publication by the same research group, and secondly, a couple of instances of data duplication were identified among the histopathological images presented within Fig. 7D.
After having considered the various issues that have been brought to light with this paper, together with an appeal from the authors that a Corrigendum be published, the Editor of Oncology Reports has ruled that the article should be retracted from the publication on account of a lack of overall confidence in the presented data. Note that the authors were not in agreement that the number of errors reported and identified were sufficient to merit the retraction of the article.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article at the corresponding author's request. After publication, the authors became aware that data from other projects were included in the figures, resulting in image overlap between this article and previous publications from other authors. Specifically:
Fig. 3a appears to overlap with Fig. 4a in [1];
Fig. 7g Cyclin D1 lanes 3 and 4 appear highly similar to Fig. 9d E-cadherin lanes 2 and 3 in [2].
Additionally, parts of images in Figs. 2d, 3a, 7g and 8f have subsequently been used in [3–7].
The authors have therefore lost confidence in the data presented in this article.
Author Kangsheng Tu has stated on behalf of all co-authors that they agree to this retraction.

Following the publication of this paper, it was drawn to the Editors' attention by a concerned reader that the Transwell cell migration data shown in Figs. 4 and 9 were strikingly similar to data appearing in different form in other articles by different authors.

Concerns were raised regarding the alleged duplication of features within the image shown in Figure 4. The first author responded to our queries but was unable to provide the original images for Figure 4. The first author explained they were responsible for the preparation of the SEM images and wishes to apologize to the readers and other authors for any errors that may have been introduced to the image which led to the retraction of the paper. However, all the authors accept responsibility for the integrity of the reported research and agree with the decision to retract the article.

The Figure 6 invasion/miR-Con panel seems to appear as the Figure 7F shRNA-NC panel from Yang et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01104), and the Figure 5 GAPDH bands also seem to appear as the Figure 5F GAPDH bands from Liu et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1042/BSR20191330). The authors were contacted regarding the concerns raised and provided the same cell image for the Figure 6 invasion/miR-Con panel as shown in the figure, as well as some western blot data; however, they were not able to provide any of the original raw scans for the western blots. Given that no additional area was visible in the provided cell image and that no original scans of the western blot data were provided, doubt still remains over the authenticity of the data.

An interested reader drew to our attention that the western blots featured in Figs. 1B and 6C contained strikingly similar protein bands, and repeating patterns of bands, comparing across the lanes of the gels. Furthermore, an image representing the Myc-YAP colony-formation assay experiment in Fig. 2C was strikingly similar to the data shown for the Control colony-formation assay experiment in Fig. 5B.
The Editorial office subsequently investigated this matter further, and noted that the western blots shown in Fig. 6A and B likewise contained strikingly similar bands that were purportedly showing the results from different experiments. After having considered the various issues that have been brought to light with this paper, together with an appeal from the authors that a Corrigendum be published, the Editor of Oncology Reports has ruled that the article should be retracted from the publication on account of a lack of overall confidence in the presented data. Note that the authors were not in agreement that the errors reported and identified were sufficient to merit the retraction of the article.

The Editors have retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding overlap in the cell and tissue images presented in the figures, as well as the cell lines used in the study. Specifically:
There appears to be overlap in Fig. 2A and B between images representing different groups.
In Fig. 2C, the NC and pre-miR-665 0 h images appear to originate from the same sample.
There appears to be overlap in Fig. 5C and D between images representing different groups.
In Fig. 8E and F, the PTPRB images in the pre-miR-665 group appear to contain an overlapping area.
L02 and SMMC-7721 cell lines have been reported to be contaminated with HeLa and are therefore unsuitable for liver cancer research.
HepG2 cells have been reported to be unsuitable as a model of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Additionally, there is no patient consent statement in the article.
The authors have stated that the image errors occurred due to incorrect data storage.
The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the presented data and the ethics of the study.
Yuanchang Hu has stated on behalf of all co-authors that they agree to this retraction.

At the authors request, the Editor and Publisher of OncoTargets and Therapy wish to retract the published article. Concerns were raised to the authors regarding the duplication of cell migration and invasion images in Figures 4 and 7. Specifically,
Figure 4C, miR-497 inhibitors, appears to have been duplicated with the same image for Figure 7D, Blank.
Figure 4C, miR-497 inhibitors and Figure 7D, Blank, both appear to have been duplicated with Figure 7D, miR-497 inhibitors, which has been flipped.
The authors were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the duplicated images, nor were they able to provide adequate original data that would verify the validity of the findings. The Editor agreed with the authors request to retract the article.

After investigating concerns of image duplication raised by a reader, evidence for image duplication in identical or altered fashion in Figures 4A, 4G, and S1C was identified. This reuse (and in part, misrepresentation) of data without appropriate attribution represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The authors do not agree to the retraction.

Following the publication of this paper, it was drawn to the Editors’ attention by a concerned reader that the Transwell cell migration assay data shown in Figs. 1C and 3D were strikingly similar to data appearing in different form in other articles by different authors.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article because data presented in Figs. 2, 3 and 4 were duplicated from previously published articles. Specifically, a set of staining images in Fig. 2I had previously been published as Fig. 3E in [1]. The actin blot in Fig. 3D had been published as part of Fig. 4B in [2], and as part of 7H in [3]. The BT474 blot in Fig. 4C was previously published as P2 in Fig. 2F of [4]. The SKBR-3 MyD88 blot in Fig. 4D originally appeared as snail in Fig. 5D in [5]. The Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions of this article. Huaying Dong states that all authors agree to this retraction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. Concerns were raised regarding a number of figures, specifically:
Figure 5C: two panels (SKI-II and SphK1 siRNA for Caki-2) appear to be nearly identical
Figure 5C: the Caki-2 Control panel appears to be nearly identical to the ACHN SKI-II panel.
Figure 5C: the Caki-2 panel for His (20 µmol/l) appears to be nearly identical to the ACHN panel for His+SKI-II.
Figure 5C: the Caki-2 panel for His+SKI-II appears to be nearly identical to the ACHN panel for His-SphK1 siRN.
Figure 5C appears to partially overlap with Figure 5G of [1].
Figure 6C: the TUNEL/Control, TUNEL/His (40 mg/kg) panels and the p-JNK1/2/His (40 mg/kg panels appear to have been previously published as the TUNEL/Control, TUNEL/His (40 mg/kg) and cleaved PARP/His (40 mg/kg) panels of Figure 4C of [2].
The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the reliability of the data reported in the article.

The Editor in Chief has retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised in regards to some figures, specifically:
· Fig. 4C: in the Hoechst 33342 row, the LV-PVT1 panel of Capan-2 appears to correspond to the sh-PVT1-1+rapa panel of HPAF-II with a rotation and background brightness difference;
· Fig. 4C: there appears to be a partial overlap between HPAF-II panels for sh-NC and sh-PVT1-1 in all three rows;
· The LV-PVT1+3MA plot in Fig. 4E is unexpectedly similar to the miR20a+PVT1 plot in Fig. S4C.
The authors did not provide a sufficient explanation. Additionally, it appears the authors initially obtained only a provisional “fast-track” ethics approval for the study and applied for full approval at revision stage. This is not in line with journal policy.
Therefore, the Editor in Chief has lost confidence in the integrity of the article's findings. Fengting Huang, Wenying Chen, Juanfei Peng, Yuanhua Li, Wanling Yang, Herui Yao and Shineng Zhang agree to this retraction. Yanyan Zhuang, Zhe Zhu and Chunkui Shao did not respond to correspondence from the Editor about this retraction.

a GSEA plot showed miR-532-5p level was inversely correlated with angiogenesis gene signatures in the TCGA the stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) data set. The abilities of in vitro capillary tube formation (b) and migration (c) of HUVEC were significantly decreased after incubating with culture medium of miR-532-5p-transfected GC cell, while potentially strengthened after incubating with culture medium of miR-532-5psilenced GC cell. The VEGFA levels (d) and MVD (e) in tumor tissue of nude mice models with subcutaneous implantation of GC were noticeably reduced when miR-532-5p was upregulated in SGC-7901 cells, while largely increased when miR-532-5p was downregulated in AGS cells. f Luciferase-reported NF-κB activity was decreased in miR-532-5p-overexpressing, while increased in miR-5325p-silenced GC cells. g EMSA indicated NF-κB activity dramatically decreased in miR-532-5p-transduced cells but increased in miR-5325p-inhibited cells. OCT-1 DNA-binding complexes served as a control. h qRT-PCR analysis showed an apparent overlap between miR532-5p-regulated gene expression and NF-κB-dependent gene expression. The pseudocolors represent the intensity scale of miR-5325p versus control or anti-miR-532-5p versus shcontrol vector, which was generated by a log 2 transformation. i Western blotting assay showed that nuclear NF-κB/p65, p-IKK-β, p-IκBα, and c-FLP expressions were decreased in miR-532-5p-overexpressing SGC7901 and MNK-45, while potentially increased in miR-532-5psilenced AGS cells. p54 was used as a nuclear loading control.

Enforced overexpression of LINC01410 largely promoted, while inhibition of LINC01410 potentially compromised the migratory (a) and invasion (b) ability of GC cells.

+Concerns/Issues About Image","Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity has retracted the article titled “Molecular Hydrogen Effectively Heals Alkali-Injured Cornea via Suppression of Oxidative Stress” [1], due to concerns with the figures. The journal was contacted by a reader who identified that Figure 5(c) in [1] is duplicated with Figure 4(j) in [2] and Figure 5(a) in [3].
The authors were asked for clarification, but did not satisfactorily address the concerns of the Editorial Board. The article is therefore being retracted due to concerns regarding the reliability of the data. Authors Dr. Jitka Cejkova and Dr. Cestmir Cejka are deceased, the remaining authors agree to the retraction.

Following the publication of this paper, it was drawn to the Editor's attention by a concerned reader that the control GAPDH western blotting bands shown in Fig. 4H on p. 496 were strikingly similar to data that were submitted for publication in advance of this article in different form by different authors at different research institutes [Liu F, Bai C and Guo Z: The prognostic value of osteopontin in limited-stage small cell lung cancer patients and its mechanism. Oncotarget 8: 70084-70096, 2017]. A further independent investigation conducted in the Editorial Office revealed that other western blotting data were likely to have been shared in common, comparing between the two articles.
Owing to the fact that the contentious data in the above article had already been submitted for publication prior to the submission of this article to Oncology Reports, the Editor has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal. After having been in contact with the authors, it was admitted that the authors Feng Chang, Jian-Na Liu and Jun-Xin Lin did not initially provide their agreement to be authors on this paper; otherwise, the rest of the authors accepted the decision to retract the paper.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article (Wei et al. 2018) because of significant concerns regarding a number of Figures presented in this work, that question the integrity of the data. After publication, overlap was detected with figures in articles submitted and published within a close time frame. Specifically, elements of Fig. 2 appear to be identical to Fig. 2 in an article published by the same authors (Cao et al. 2019). Figure 1 and 2 appear similar to Figs. 1 and 2 respectively in an article by different authors (Jieensinue et al. 2018). Furthermore, it appears one image from Fig. 2a (Matrine 1 nM) has been flipped and re-used in Fig. 6 J as Tan IIA 5uM in Jieensinue et al. (2018). The same image appears to have been also used in Fig. 6A in Cao et al. (2019).
The authors stated that a number of figures were inserted by mistake, namely Figs. 1c and d, Fig. 2a, f,g,h,k and l.
The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the integrity of the data in this article.
The authors have not explicitly stated whether they agree to this retraction notice.

The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding the binding site between IL-6 mRNA and miR-665. Specifically, the sequence of IL6 3'UTR reported in this article appears to refer to ILR6 rather than IL6. Additionally, in the TargetScan database, miR-665 does not appear to be among the predicted miRNAs targeting IL6. Further checks by the Publisher identified the following concerns with the presented data:
In Figs. 4f and 6g, three images appear to originate from the same sample (4f ALP Vector and sh-NC, and 6g Antagomir-665+sh-IL6).
In Figs. 5f, 6f and 7a, all western blot images have highly similar background features, and a number of bands appear to have straight vertical edges, which are inconsistent with the backgrounds.
The authors have stated that Figs. 4f and 6g indeed contain errors, and that the western blots are not presented in their original state. They have provided raw data to address these concerns; however, these data contain further inconsistencies and highly similar images. The Editors-in-Chief therefore no longer have confidence in the data and conclusions of this article.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article on the corresponding author’s request after becoming aware of inconsistencies in the data set. Specifically, data presented in Figs. 2c and 3f appear to derive from data in [1] by different authors. Further checks by the publisher identified an additional concern about the similarity in the GAPDH controls in Fig. 4d. The authors stated that they no longer have access to the raw data. Therefore, the Editor has lost confidence in the data presented in the article. Zhiwei Chen, Shun Lu, Qingquan Luo, Jia Huang and Ziming Li have agreed to this retraction but not to the wording of this retraction notice. Zhenping Ding and Shengping Shen have not responded to any correspondence from the editor/publisher about this retraction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article [1] due to overlapping images with other articles, specifically:
Figure 8d: the Beclin1 Vehicle and XAG (80 mg/kg) panels appear to overlap with the cleaved caspase-3 Vehicle and Exanthone (80 mg/kg/day) panels of Fig. 7c of [2].
Figure 8d: the p-c-Jun Vehicle panel appears to overlap with the Beclin Vehicle panel of Fig. 7c of [2].
Figure 3a: the Bel7402 XAG + 3-MA panel appears to be identical to the SMMC7721 Vehicle panel.
Figure 3c: the Bel7402 XAG + Atg5 siRNA panel appears to be identical to the SMMC7721 Vehicle panel.
Figure 3c: the SMMC7721 Atg5 siRNA panel appears to be similar to the SKOV3 Control and A2780 Control panels of Fig. 1e of [3], the Vehicle panel of Fig. 4b in [4] and the HT29 Control panel of Fig. 7b of [5]
Figure 8d: the Vehicle CHOP, GRP78 and p-JNK panels appears to be similar to the Ki-67 EX(40 mg/kg) panel, the IL-18 Vehicle panel and the IL-18 EX(20 mg/kg) panel of [6].
Figure 8d: the XAG(40 mg/kg) CHOP panel appears to be similar to the KI-67 EX(20 mg/kg) panel of [6].
Figure 8d: the XAG(80 mg/kg) CHOP and GRP78 panels appear to be similar to the KI-67 Vehicle and the IL-18 EX(40 mg/kg) panels of [6].
The data reported in this article are therefore unreliable.

After publication of the article [1], the authors reported errors of inter-duplication in Fig. 4f , Fig. 5g and Fig. 5h. The authors have confirmed that the “Transwell assay” images of “Mock+ miR-NC in AGS cells, circ-PSMC3+miR-296-5p in MGC803 cells, circ-PSMC3+miR-296-5p in AGS cells” group were mistakenly presented in the original Fig. 5h. This mistake was caused by that the folder was poorly managed and the same pictures are used unintentionally. The “Migration assay” image of “miR-NC of 24h in AGS cells” in Fig. 4f contained an inter-duplication in error with the image of “Mock+ miR-NC of 24h in MGC803 cells” in Fig. 5g, which was caused by the misplacement of the list of the “Migration assay” images in Fig. 5g.The histogram does not need to be changed, because we did not use the wrong picture when analyzing the original data, and the conclusion of this part is a negative result, which does not affect the overall conclusion of the article. The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused by unintentional misplace.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. Concerns have been raised regarding a number of figures, specifically:
Figure 9A: the panels for 0 h/siRNA-LHX2 and 0 h/miR-506 inhibitor + siRNA-LHX2 appear to partially overlap
Figure 9B: the panels for 0 h/Blank and 0 h/NC appear to partially overlap
Figure 9B: the panels for 0 h/miR-506 mimic and 0 h/miR-506 inhibitor appear to be identical
Additionally, the background of the western blots in Figures 2B, 4A, 5B, 5D, 5H and 5 J appear to look unexpectedly clean. Author Zhang-Suo Liu has also stated that he was unaware of the submission and publication of this article. The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the reliability of the data reported in the article.
The authors have not responded to correspondence regarding this retraction notice.

The Editors have retracted this article [1] because figure 2 has been substantially duplicated from a previously published article by Chen B et al., 2018 [2]. There is also significant and uncited overlap in the patient population between the two articles resulting in concerns relating to the scientific validity and novelty of the data.
None of the authors agree to this retraction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article at the corresponding author's request. After publication, concerns were raised regarding the images presented in the figures. Specifically:
In Fig. 1d, the Control and Test images appear to originate from the same sample.
Fig. 2d Control appears highly similar to Fig. 2b circRNA overexpression group in the authors' other article that was under consideration within a similar time frame [1].
In Fig. 4a, the Control and Test 0h images appear to overlap.
In Figs. 4b and 6b, the 0h images appear to contain overlapping areas.
In Fig. 4c, there appears to be an overlapping area between the SSC9 Control and Test images.
In Fig. 7d, based on the shapes of the bands, it appears that the caspase-3 blot is shifted by one lane, so the group labels don't seem to match the samples.
The authors have checked the data underlying this article and stated that incorrect images were used. The authors and the Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer have confidence in the presented data.

Fig. 2d: Migration image of shC12orf59#1 on MKN-45 cells (upper middle); Migration and Invasion images of shC12orf59 on AGS cells (right)
Fig. 2e: Invasion images of vector and C12orf59 on HGC-27 cells (lower)
Fig. 4e: Invasion image of shControl on MKN-45 cells (lower left)
Fig. 4i: Migration image of shC12orf59#1 on HUVEC cells (middle)
Fig. 5h: Invasion image of C12orf59 on MKN-45 cells (lower middle)
Fig. S6b: Migration and Invasion images of miR-654-5p and control on MNK-45 and AGS cells
The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented.

The Editor has retracted this article at the Corresponding Author's request. After publication, concerns were raised regarding highly similar images used in this and other articles, specifically:
In Fig. 2b, the circRNA overexpression group images appear highly similar to the Control group in Fig. 2d of ([1], now retracted);
Figs. 4c, 4d and 8f appear to contain overlapping panels with Figs. 4d, 4e, 7e and 7f of [2];
In Fig. 5a, Mock SCC25 and CAL27 appear to contain an overlapping area.
In Fig. 5b, Mock SCC25 and CAL27 appear to original from the same sample, with rotation and minor modification.
The authors have stated that these images were misused. The Editor therefore no longer has confidence in the presented data.

At the authors request, the Editor and Publisher of OncoTargets and Therapy wish to retract the published article. The authors advised the journal that concerns had been raised regarding the integrity of the data. The concerns related to the duplication of migration and invasion images in Figure 2. Specifically,
Figure 2D, HCT116, NC, has been duplicated with the same image for Figure 1E, TPC-1, miR-199a-5p, from Ma et al, 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.051).

Despite the authors’ assistance, they were unable to explain how the images came to be duplicated, and, as the validity of the published work cannot be verified, we are therefore retracting the article.

The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article at the corresponding author's request. After publication, the authors found that the data could not be replicated. This was caused by mislabelling of patient blood samples and the use of contaminated cell lines (SGC-7901, BGC-823 and MGC-803) in this study.
The authors therefore no longer have confidence in the presented results.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","The journal retracts the article “Beneficial Role of HO-1-SIRT1 Axis in Attenuating Angiotensin II-Induced Adipocyte Dysfunction” [1], cited above.
Following publication, concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding the figures. The microscopy image for one of the experimental groups in Figure 4A was duplicated, appearing in Figure 1A of another published paper [2]. The authors state this was due to carelessness. Additionally, the actin panel in Figure 2D [1] was similar to Figures 2A and 6E of another published paper [3]. The actin panel in Figure 2B [1] was similar to that in Figure 2 of another published paper [4].
The International Journal of Molecular Sciences Editorial Office has taken the decision to retract the paper. The editor-in-chief approved this retraction.
The authors agree with the retraction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding high similarity between the sh-Control Invasion image in Fig. 10C and the si-Control Invasion image in Fig. 5E in the authors' other article ([1], now retracted) published within a similar time frame. Further investigation by the Published has identified that the sh-Control Invasion image in Fig. 10C also appears to overlap with the HCCLM2-miR-16-5p EV image in Fig. S4B.
Additionally, the article appears highly similar to another article from an unrelated group ([2], now retracted).
The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the presented data.
None of the authors have responded to any correspondence from the publisher about this retraction notice.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article because Figs. 2 and 5 appear to contain overlapping panels:
In Fig. 2D, the panels HTR8 si-NC and HTR8 pcDNA3.1 appear to have a considerable region of overlap
In Fig. 5C, the panels HRT8 si-TUG1 + miR-29b mimic and HTR8 si-TUG1 + miR-29b inhibitor appear to have a considerable region of overlap

The Editor and Publisher of OncoTargets and Therapy wish to retract the published article. Concerns were raised following the authors request to make corrections to images in Supplemental Figures 3, 4 and 5. Our investigation found that images within these figures appeared to have duplicated and further image duplication was found within Figures 3 and 4 from the main body of the article. Specifically,
Figure 3B, U-251MG, None, appears to have been duplicated with the same image in Figure 3C, U-87MG, sh-CXCL8#1, which has been rotated.
Figure 4A, U-251MG, LV-Vector, N-cadherin, appears to have been duplicated with regions from the image used in Figure 4A, U-251MG, LV-Vector, Vimentin.
Figure 4A, U-87MG, CXCL8-shRNA, DAPI/CXCL8, appears to have been duplicated with regions from the image used in Figure 4A, U-251MG, LV-Vector, Vimentin.
Figure S3C, U-87MG, None, appears to have been duplicated with the same image in Figure S3D, U-251MG, Vector.
Figure S3C, U-87MG, CXCL8(KD), appears to have been duplicated with the same image in Figure S4D, U-251MG, Vector.
Figure S4E, U-87MG, None, appears to have been duplicated with the same image in Figure S4E, U-87MG, Vector.
The authors cooperated with the investigation and provided data associated with the study. However, despite the authors’ assistance, it was still not clear how the images came to be duplicated, and, as we cannot verify the validity of the published work, we are therefore retracting the article and the authors were notified of this.

At the authors request, the Editor and Publisher of OncoTargets and Therapy wish to retract the published article. The authors notified the journal that the primers meant for miR-139-3p had mistakenly been designed for miR-129-3p and the conclusions described in the reported study were unreliable. In addition, it was also found that images in Figure 3 had been duplicated. Specifically,
Figure 3A, OVCAR-3, 0 h, miR-NC appears to have been duplicated with the same image for Figure 3A, OVCAR-3, 0 h, miR-139-3p.
The authors were unable to explain how the incorrect primers came to be designed or how the images in Figure 3A came be to be duplicated. The authors were also unable to provide the original data for their study. The Editor agreed with the authors request to retract the article.
Our decision-making was informed by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retraction.

In Fig. 2h, the protein band of YTHDF3 was mistakenly duplicated into the protein band of Cyr61.
In Fig. 2n, the image of Control+Vector treatment group was mistakenly duplicated into the siMETTL3 + YTHDF3 treatment group, and the image of METTL3 + siYTHDF3 treatment group was unintentionally duplicated into the METTL3 + YTHDF3 treatment group which were determined by transwell assay.
In Fig. 6k, the IHC image of ABCG2 was unintentionally duplicated onto the IHC image of ERCC1.

YTHDF3 recognizes m6A modification and promotes cellular growth and migration via YAP upregulation. h The expressions of YAP and its target genes, CTGF and Cyr61, were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot. n The cellular invasion and migration growths were analyzed by transwell assay.

These errors were mistakenly introduced when organising the results; however, these errors have no bearing on the work’s scientific conclusions as the statistical results are based on the correct pictures.
The authors would like to note the correct versions of each of the above-noted sub-figures ahead. The only changes are to the panels of Fig. 2h, Fig. 2n, and Fig. 6k, and the rest of the figures are identical to the published version; furthermore, no other errors were found after repeated checking of the published data.

This article has been retracted at the request of the editors.
Molecular Therapy – Oncolytics is retracting this article. After investigating concerns of image duplication raised by a reader, evidence for image duplication in identical or altered fashion in Figures 1A, 1E, 3A, 3C, 4C, and 4G was identified. This reuse (and in part, misrepresentation) of data without appropriate attribution represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system.

Redundant publications overweigh the relative importance of published findings and distort the academic record of the authors. One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is therefore that authors declare explicitly that the paper has not been previously published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. As such, this article represents a misuse of the scientific publishing system.
The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter, and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12943-020-1145-5
The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding suspected image overlap with three other articles [1–3]. Specifically, in Fig. 2d, all subpanels appear to be highly similar to the images in Fig. 3c (rotated) in [1]. In Fig. 2f, a number of images appear highly similar to those in Figs. 5a and c in ([2], now retracted) and 3e in [3]. In addition, Fig. 5e appears to be drawn by hand.
The authors have provided the original data and revised figures to address the concerns. However, the original data contains highly similar backgrounds in the western blot gel photographs. Additionally, the source, number and sex of animals are different between the Ethics approval document and the Methods section of the article.
The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the presented data and the ethical standards of the study.
Hui Cao agrees to this retraction. Mingli Han and Huaying Dong have stated on behalf of all co-authors that they agree to this retraction.

In this paper, the authors report that exosomal circ_0006156 impacts progression of papillary thyroid cancer. The authors reported that they reanalyzed these problems and that after communication with the “revision agency,” the agency could not guarantee the uniqueness of the paper, including its data, charts, and photographs. The authors feel it necessary to explicitly correct the scientific record and are therefore retracting the article.
The authors apologize to the scientific community for any inconvenience this has caused.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Yin R, Liu J, Zhao D, Wang F. Onco Targets Ther. 2020;13:2261–2274.
The Editor and Publisher of OncoTargets and Therapy wish to retract the published article. Concerns were raised regarding the alleged duplication of images in Figures 2C, 4B and 6B with similar images from unrelated articles, specifically:
Figure 2C, panel U2OS si-ASB16-AS1 appears to have been duplicated with a similar image in Figure 6C, panel Huh7 si-GAS6-AS+NC inhibitor from Ai et al, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2020.1729323).
Figure 4B, panels HOS agomir-NC; agomir-760 appear to have been duplicated with similar images in Figure 6C, panel Sw1990 miR-769 mimics+pcDNA3.1-ETS1 and 5C, panel Panc-1 si-ETS1, respectively from Cheng et al, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S218876).
Figure 6B, panel U2OS si-NC appears to have been duplicated with similar images in Figures 5C, panel H522 NC siRNA from Kang et al, 2019 (https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S204004) and 3D, panel si-HAND2-AS1 from Yu et al, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S233256), respectively.
The authors responded to our queries but were unable to provide an explanation for the alleged image duplication and could not provide the original raw data or ethics approval documents for their study and have therefore agreed to retract the article.
Our decision-making was informed by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retraction.

Following the publication of this paper, it was drawn to the Editors' attention by a concerned reader that certain of the flow cytometric data shown in Fig. 4I were strikingly similar to data appearing in different form in another article by different authors. Owing to the fact that the contentious data in the above article had already been published elsewhere prior to its submission to International Journal of Molecular Medicine, the Editor has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article [1]. A report (https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-yakkanti-sudhakar) by the US Office of Research Integrity has concluded that the image shown as the protein band tumstatin (α3(IV)NC1) in Fig. 2 (lanes 2–4) was also used in [2] to represent a different experiment. The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the conclusions presented in this article. Akulapalli Sudhakar does not agree with this retraction. The Editor-in-Chief was not able to obtain a current email address for Chandra S Boosani.

Figure 3c: the bottom left panel appears to partially overlap with the 769-P shNC panel of Figure 7h.
Figure 3d: the top left panel appears to partially overlap with the ACHN shrcireTLK1 panel in Figure 7j
Figure 7h: the ACHN shcireTLK1+CBx4 panel appears to partially overlap with the ACHN shNC panel in Figure 7j.
Additionally concerns were raised regarding the tumor sizes as displayed in Figure 8i. The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer have confidence in the results and conclusions of this article.

The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding potential image overlap within the published figures. Specifically:
In Fig. 4A, the HBP images for the Naive and 14 d groups appear to contain an overlapping area.
In Fig. 5B, there appears to be overlap between the Sham-14 d and HBP-7 d, as well as NMP-1 d and BP-14 d images.
In Fig. 9A, the western blot images representing MYD88-1 d and p-IκBα-7 d, as well as p-IκBα-Naive and p-p65-7 d appear highly similar.
The authors have stated that these errors occurred due to mishandling of the data. The Editors-in-Chief therefore no longer have confidence in the presented data.
All authors agree to this retraction.

This article has been retracted at the request of the editor-in-chief.
Corresponding author D.F. reached out to the journal to request a correction because ""Fig. 2F was displayed mistakenly."" An investigation by the editorial office revealed evidence for image duplication in identical or altered fashion in Figures 2F and 4D as well evidence of image duplication in identical or altered fashion between Figures 2F and 4D in the this article and Figure 5H in “MiRNA-211 suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting SPARC in human hepatocellular carcinoma” (Deng et al., 2016, Sci. Rep. 6, 26679, https://doi.org/10.1038/srep26679) and Figure 3B in “Core fucosylated glycan-dependent inhibitory effect of QSOX1-S on invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma” (Zhang et al., 2019, Cell Death Discov., 5, 84, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-019-0164-8). This reuse (and in part misrepresentation) of data without appropriate attribution represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The authors do not agree to retract.

+Concerns/Issues About Image","Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity has retracted the article titled “An Immunohistochemical Study of the Increase in Antioxidant Capacity of Corneal Epithelial Cells by Molecular Hydrogen, Leading to the Suppression of Alkali-Induced Oxidative Stress” [1], due to concerns with the figures. The journal was contacted by a reader who identified that Figure 4(j) in [1] is duplicated with Figure 5(c) in [2], and Figure 5(a) in [3]. Additionally panel 4 of Figure 3 in [1] is duplicated with the H2, Day 4 panel of Figure 4(a) in a now retracted article [4].
The authors were asked for clarification, but did not satisfactorily address the concerns of the Editorial Board. The article is therefore being retracted due to concerns regarding the reliability of the data. Authors Dr. Jitka Cejkova and Dr. Cestmir Cejka are deceased, the remaining authors agree to the retraction.

The authors have retracted this article because they found that, in repeated experiments, the results could not be reproduced. The authors believe that this may be due to a potential contamination of the HepG2 liver cancer cell line with T24 bladder cancer cell line. The data reported in this article are therefore unreliable.

The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding potential image duplication, specifically:
Several panels in Figs. 1a and 2b have been previously published in [1].
The same actin western blot bands are presented (rotated 180 degrees) in Figs. 1E and 7D.
Actin western blot bands appear highly similar in Fig. 6A 7d and 6B 3d.
Additionally, substantial text overlap was identified with the authors' earlier article [2].
The Editors-in-Chief therefore no longer have confidence in the presented data and the originality of the work.
Authors Jianxiao Chen, Jianfeng Xie, Ming Xue, Ling Liu and Yi Yang agree to this retraction. Authors Xiwen Zhang and Haibo Qiu have not responded to any correspondence from the editor or publisher about this retraction.

The above article, published online on 17 July 2020 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the journal Editor in Chief, Kevin Ryan and John Wiley and Sons Ltd. The retraction has been agreed following an investigation into concerns raised by a third party, which revealed inappropriate duplications of image panels within the article (multiple panels of fig. 2G and 3C), as well as inappropriate duplications of panels in figs 1D, 2G, and 3C with another study [1], which shares two of the authors. Compelling raw data was not available. Thus, the editors consider the conclusions of this manuscript substantially compromised.

The Editors-in-Chief have retracted this article [1]. Concerns were raised with a number of figures, specifically:
Fig. 3d blank cell culture for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 appear identical to Fig. 4d blank cell culture for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 respectively.
Fig. 3d charts appear to be identical to all Fig. 4d charts.
Fig. 3f blank cell cultures appear to be the same as Fig. 4f blank cell cultures.
Fig. 3g blank cell cultures appear to be the same as Fig. 4g blank cell cultures.
Fig. 3i blank tissue samples appear to be the same as Fig. 4i blank tissue samples.
Additionally, the Editors-in-Chief found that blank control values are missing in the raw data for Fig. 4a and that the variation between miRNA mimic and miRNA inhibitor appears to be unrealistically small. The Editors-in-Chief have therefore concluded that the data reported in this article are unreliable.
The authors agree with the retraction but disagree with the wording of the retraction notice.

During an internal review of this submission, concerns arose that this article was submitted by an unauthorised third-party.
An internal investigation revealed the following additional concerns:
In Figure 2D, sections of the Mock migration panel and the siNC migration panel appear highly similar.
In Figure 4D, the siNC+inhibitor NC invasion panel appears highly similar to the siRHPN1-AS1+miR-7-5p inhibitor migration panel.
In Figure 4D, sections of the Mock migration panel appear highly similar to sections of the siNC+inhibitor NC migration panel.
The authors were unable to explain how this may have occurred and requested withdrawal of the article.
Due to concerns around the role played by the originally undisclosed third party in the research and publication of this article, and questions around the integrity of the author group, the Executive Editor retracts this article.

This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief of Molecular Therapy – Nucleic Acids.
Concerns regarding data integrity were raised by the National Science Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which were based on a PubPeer thread showing similarities among western blots in this article and several other articles by unrelated authors (https://pubpeer.com/publications/037CC4BEC12B5D29C7D3F69A66FB7E). Per journal policy, the editors, at their discretion, may request deposition of any or all original data files for examination by the reviewers and/or editors. As a result of the authors’ refusal to provide these data—in violation of journal policy—and the allegations of fraud, the editors feel that findings of the manuscript cannot be relied upon.

This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief. In a PubPeer thread (https://pubpeer.com/publications/8031651DAFBDB359BE80270D26B91C), readers drew attention to similarities between the western blots and figure layout in this article and articles by unrelated authors as well as irregularities in the tumor images. Image analysis performed by the journal's editorial office revealed evidence of image duplication in Figure 8D and image manipulation in Figures 2I, 5D, and 8D. This reuse (and in part misrepresentation) of data without appropriate attribution represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The authors did not respond when contacted about the retraction.

The authors, Yongqiang Wei, Xiaolei Wei and Ru Feng, each responded to our queries informing the journal that they had no knowledge of the article and believed the first author, Hong Zeng, had published the article without their permission. Despite several attempts, Hong Zeng could not be contacted by the journal. The Research Integrity Office of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, was contacted but was unable to satisfactorily verify the explanation provided by the authors.

After publication, the authors identified flaws in the study design and the data.
Further assessment of the article identified the following issues:
The number of tumor cells inoculated into mice for the xenograft experiment was higher than recommended by internationally accepted standards.
In Fig. 2d, the western blot image backgrounds and empty spaces in lane 1 appear remarkably similar.
In Fig. 6c and d, a number of tumor images appear remarkably similar.
In addition, the authors were unable to locate the original ethics approval documents.
The Editors-in-Chief therefore no longer have confidence in the presented data and the conclusions of this article.

The authors did respond to our queries and explained that their laboratory does not have access to an HPLC device and the HPLC experiments were performed by a third-party. They further explained that errors had been made during calculations of the retention times, but they were unable to explain how this occurred. In addition, discrepancies remained in the retention times of the corrected HPLC chromatograms the authors provided, and there was a lack of adequate data associated with these experiments.
The Editor determined that the explanation for the calculation errors and availability of original data were both insufficient and had concerns over the reliability of the reported findings. The Editor requested for the article to be retracted and the authors were notified of this.

Discrepancies in scope
Discrepancies in the description of the research reported
Discrepancies between the availability of data and the research described
Inappropriate citations
Incoherent, meaningless and/or irrelevant content included in the article
Peer-review manipulation
The presence of these indicators undermines our confidence in the integrity of the article's content and we cannot, therefore, vouch for its reliability. Please note that this notice is intended solely to alert readers that the content of this article is unreliable. We have not investigated whether authors were aware of or involved in the systematic manipulation of the publication process.
In addition, our investigation has also shown that one or more of the following human-subject reporting requirements has not been met in this article: ethical approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) committee or equivalent, patient/participant consent to participate, and/or agreement to publish patient/participant details (where relevant).
Wiley and Hindawi regrets that the usual quality checks did not identify these issues before publication and have since put additional measures in place to safeguard research integrity.
We wish to credit our own Research Integrity and Research Publishing teams and anonymous and name external researchers and research integrity experts for contributing to this investigation.
The corresponding author, as the representative of all authors, has been given the opportunity to register their agreement or disagreement to this retraction. We have kept a record of any response received.

Figure 3D, panel HS683 si-FOXD3-AS1 appears to have been duplicated with Figure 7D, panel HS683 miR-128-3p mimic.
Figure 3D, panel HS683 miR-128-3p inhibitor appears to have been duplicated with Figure 7D, panel HS683 OE-SZRD1.
Figure 3F, panel U251 Control appears to have been duplicated with Figure 7F, panel U251 Control.
Figure 3F, panel U251 miR-128-3p inhibitor appears to have been duplicated with Figure 7F, panel U251 OE-SZRD1.
The authors responded to our queries but could not provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged duplication or provide adequate raw data for their study. The findings of the study were deemed invalid and the Editor requested for the article to be retracted.
Our decision-making was informed by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retraction.
The retracted article will remain online to maintain the scholarly record, but it will be digitally watermarked on each page as “Retracted”.",,"['Data', 'Images']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Duplication of Data', 'Duplication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Original Data Not Provided', 'Unreliable Data', 'Unreliable Image']","['Data', 'Images']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Duplication of Data', 'Duplication of Image', 'Unreliable Data', 'Unreliable Image']","['Data', 'Images', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Text']","['Concern/Issues about Article', 'Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Duplication of Article', 'Duplication of Data', 'Duplication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image']","['Authorship', 'Data', 'Images', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Cites Retracted Work', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Contamination of Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Copyright Claims', 'Duplicate Publication through Error by Journal/ Publisher', 'Duplication of Article', 'Duplication of Data', 'Duplication of Image', 'Duplication of Text', 'Error by Third Party', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Error in Data', 'Error in Image', 'Error in Materials', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'False Affiliation', 'False/Forged Authorship', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Misconduct by Third Party', 'Original Data Not Provided', 'Plagiarism of Article', 'Plagiarism of Data', 'Plagiarism of Image', 'Plagiarism of Text', 'Removed', 'Results Not Reproducible', 'Retract and Replace', 'Unreliable Image', 'Updated to Correction', 'Updated to Retraction']",[],[],[],[]

This article has been retracted at the request of the authors and editor-in-chief.
After publication of the article, the authors contacted the journal to report that the results presented in Figures 5B, 6C, and 7B were not reproducible. During an investigation, the editorial office found that some of the primers and antibodies used to obtain results shown in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 do not target the reported genes and proteins or do not work in the reported context. Some of the original data provided by the authors does not match the published article. The editor-in-chief has also been made aware that this article is included in a list of suspected paper mill papers (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r0MyIYpagBc58BRF9c3luWNlCX8VUvUuPyYYXzxWvgY/edit#gid=262337249) and that the western blots in Figures 5B, 6C, and 7B have been highlighted on PubPeer (https://pubpeer.com/publications/7D14545A574136C252ADF9ABD64706?) due to their similarity to western blots in other suspected paper mill papers. Given these issues, the Editor-in-Chief has lost faith in the findings presented in the article.

Please note that this notice is intended solely to alert readers that the content of this article is unreliable. We have not investigated whether authors were aware of or involved in the systematic manipulation of the publication process.
Wiley and Hindawi regrets that the usual quality checks did not identify these issues before publication and have since put additional measures in place to safeguard research integrity.
We wish to credit our own Research Integrity and Research Publishing teams and anonymous and named external researchers and research integrity experts for contributing to this investigation.
The corresponding author, as the representative of all authors, has been given the opportunity to register their agreement or disagreement to this retraction. We have kept a record of any response received.

+Concerns/Issues with Peer Review","Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine has retracted the article titled “Epidemiological Features of COVID-19 in Makkah City: A Retrospective Data Analysis” [1] due to concerns that the peer review process has been compromised.
Following an investigation conducted by the Hindawi Research Integrity team [2], significant concerns were identified with the peer reviewers assigned to this article; the investigation has concluded that the peer review process was compromised. We therefore can no longer trust the peer review process and the article is being retracted with the agreement of the Chief Editor.
The authors do not agree to the retraction.

The above articles, published in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, have been retracted by the Journal. The decision is the result of an investigation based on concerns raised by a third party. Specific concerns are as follows. First, as acknowledged by the authors, data overlap and/or copying has occurred between the two manuscripts. Second, the authors have not provided a reasonable explanation for this major problem. Third, adequate data error-checking or validation has not been provided by the authors to ensure that the remaining results presented in the papers accurately represent the sourced data. Given these facts, the Journal has lost confidence in the totality of data described in the two papers. Because of this, and because of insufficient answers to repeated inquiries, we have made the decision to retract both articles.",,"['Data', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Duplication of Data', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Unreliable Data']","['Data', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Duplicate Publication through Error by Journal/ Publisher', 'Duplication of Data', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Original Data Not Provided', 'Plagiarism of Data', 'Unreliable Data']","['Data', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concern/Issues about Article', 'Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Investigation by Third Party']","['Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process']",[],[],[],[],[]

The authors have retracted this article. After publication, the authors realized there were potential errors with figure labels and the cell lines used in the experiments. Additional checks have identified that:
Fig. 1c states that co-localization of CD206 and miR-15b-5p is presented, but only images for miR-15b-5p and DAPI are presented.
Fig. 1i blots appear to have deleted backgrounds and an artifact in the Calnexin image.
Figs. 1b, 3e and 5c use SGC-7901 cells, which are contaminated with HeLa.
Fig. 5i MKN-45 data don’t appear to match Fig. S2c.
Fig. 7c AGS BRMS1 data don’t appear to match Fig. S2f.
Fig. S2a MKN-45 VIM lanes 1 and 2 have similar artifacts on the right side of the bands.
The study did not obtain ethics approval prior to the start of the experiment.
The authors have been able to provide alternative data for Figs. 1i, S2a, c and f to address some of these concerns. However, the cell line and ethics issues could not be resolved.
All authors agree to this retraction.

Using blinded protocols, experiments were done to see if the results based on this reagent could be replicated. Specifically, the repeat experiments examined the activation of dendritic cells, activation of cytotoxic T cells, induction of tumor immunity, modulation of allergic responses, breaking tolerance in the RIP-OVA diabetes model, and the reprogramming of Th2 and T regulatory cells. In no case did these repeat studies reveal any evidence that the B7-DCXAb reagent had the previously reported activity. The authors of this paper therefore wish to retract this paper because of the inability to reproduce key aspects of the studies and hence the results in them cannot be considered reliable.

Replication data have been provided in support of results in Figure 5A, pcyclin D1/cyclin D1/αtubulin upper left, lower left, and upper right panels as well as Figure 5B pERK/ERK upper right and lower left panels. However, these data did not resolve the concerns about western blot data reporting in the original figure.
In light of the unresolved concern about Figure 5 that calls into question the integrity of the reported results, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
AHA, BT did not respond. LC, CLE, and VdF disagree with retraction and maintain that all the findings of the work reported in this article are still reliable.

In following up the experiments reported in this paper, we have discovered that the polarity phenotypes of Dystroglycan and perlecan mutant clones under starvation conditions shown in Figures 4, 5, 6F, 6H, and 6J are the result of an artifact. We now believe that these panels do not represent real clones with a polarity phenotype, but rather false clones caused by a damage-induced artifact that creates patches of GFP-negative cells that mimic the appearance of a mutant clone with apical-basal polarity defects. Bona fide Dystroglycan and perlecan mutant clones marked using a different system do not show this phenotype, and thus our conclusion that they are required for the apical-basal polarity of the follicle cells under conditions of energetic stress is incorrect. We have described this damage-induced artifact in an article in Biology Open (Haack, T., Bergstralh, D., and St Johnston, D. (2013). Damage to the Drosophila follicle cell epithelium produces “false clones” with apparent polarity phenotypes. http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/bio.20134671). We apologize for any inconvenience that this erroneous conclusion may have caused. The results pertaining to the characterization of null Dg alleles and their role in basal planar cell polarity and egg shape remain valid. In light of our new data, the results from the paper lead to the conclusion that neither Dg nor Dys has an essential role in follicle cell polarity.",,"['Data', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Doing the Right Thing', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Data', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Unreliable Data', 'Unreliable Results']","['Data', 'Methods', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'Unreliable Data', 'Unreliable Results']","['Data', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concern/Issues about Article', 'Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results']","['Images', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Contamination of Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Duplicate Publication through Error by Journal/ Publisher', 'Duplication of Image', 'Error in Cell Lines/Tissues']",[],[],[],[]

+Concerns/Issues About Image","Following the publication of this article [1], the Ohio State University investigated the results presented in Fig 1 and concluded that the Fig 1A panel was produced by merging and reorientation of data from multiple different experiments, performed months apart, creating a composite Fig that did not represent the experimental conditions accurately. Following these findings, the institutional Committee recommended retraction of this article [1].
In addition to the institute’s findings, editorial reassessment of the article also raised concerns regarding the results presented in Fig 2B and Fig 3. Specifically, when adjusting the colour levels to visualise the background, there appear to be horizonal and vertical irregularities in the background of multiple panels presented in Fig 2B and Fig 3.
The authors provided repeat experiment data for the results presented in Fig 1A. However, these data were not sufficient to resolve the concerns pertaining to image fabrication that were confirmed by the institutional Committee. The original data underlying Figs 1, 2, and 3 either have not been provided for editorial review or are no longer available due to the time elapsed since the original experiments were conducted. In the absence of the original underlying data, the concerns with these Figs cannot be resolved.
In light of the inappropriate image manipulations affecting the Fig 1A results, and the unresolved concerns affecting multiple Fig 2B and Fig 3 panels that question the integrity of these data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
TM, CP, PY, and STJ agreed with the retraction. KG and SM responded but expressed neither agreement nor disagreement with the retraction. RC, HK, JD, SB, AM, and TH either did not respond directly or could not be reached. KG, TM, and STJ stand by the article’s findings.

+Falsification/Fabrication of Data
+Duplication of Image","Following publication, concerns were raised about similarities between two figures in this PLOS ONE publication [1] and images published by the same corresponding author in the Journal of Surgical Research [2] and ACS Nano [3].
PLOS ONE Figure 3c [1], is similar to Journal of Surgical Research Figure 4a [2] and ACS Nano Figure 4c [3]. The voltage values in PLOS ONE Figure 3c [1] and Journal of Surgical Research Figure 4a [2] are identical if the time coordinates are offset by 6 ns. Comparing PLOS ONE Figure 3c [1] and ACS Nano Figure 4c [3], the traces appear identical except in the 0–25 ns interval, and the unit labels on both x- and y-axes differ between the two figures.
PLOS ONE Figure 3d [1] is similar to the original published version of Journal of Surgical Research Figure 4d [2]. The traces are identical when offset on the x-axis and scaled in the y-axis, and the trace appears to include a segment that is repeated three times within each figure.
The authors noted that errors were made during preparation of the figures in the PLOS ONE article, and claim that both sets of figures were used in these articles as illustrative examples of the presence or absence of a single plasmonic nanobubble event by showing typical individual time-responses. An erratum was published in the Journal of Surgical Research in 2015, providing a new image for Figure 4d [4].
The Rice University Office of Research investigated these concerns and concluded that there was evidence of data falsification involving Figures 3c and 3d of the PLOS ONE article. Due to the concerns about image duplication and data falsification, and in line with Rice University’s recommendation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

+Concerns/Issues About Image","After publication of this article [1] concerns were raised about the following figures:
The GAPDH western blot panel for IMR-32 in Fig 1B appears similar to the GAPDH panel for IMR-32 in Fig 2B. These represent the same experimental conditions.
In Fig 1E, all of the corresponding Non-IR panels appear similar for SK-N-AS and NB1691. In addition, the Non-IR Mock panels appear similar to the IR, SK-N-AS, pEV panel.
The GAPDH panel for SK-N-AS in Fig 2B appears similar to the GAPDH panel for NB1691 in Fig 3A.
The GAPDH panel for IMR-32 in Fig 4A appears similar to the GAPDH panel for NB1691 in Fig 6A.
In the IMR-32 pc-Jun (ser 63) blot shown in Fig 5, when levels are adjusted the background in lane 3 appears different than that in other lanes.
In Fig 7C, there appears to be a region of overlap between SPARC panels for Non-IR Mock (upper left quadrant) and Non-IR pEV (lower right quadrant).
In S1B Fig., the GAPDH panels for SK-N-AS and NB1691 appear similar.
The University of Illinois at Chicago investigated this work and found evidence of data falsification involving Fig 1E.
In light of the above concerns that call into question the validity and reliability of the reported results and following the outcome of the institution’s investigation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The authors either did not reply to the retraction notification or could not be reached.

+Duplication of Image","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding multiple figures. Specifically,
The PA700/S10B panel in Fig 2B and OGT and PA700/S10B panels in Fig 3A appear similar despite representing different conditions.
The PA700/S10B panels in Figs 2E and 3B appear similar.
The PA700/S10B panels in Figs 6A, 6B, and 6C appear similar.
These issues were discussed with the first author and the corresponding author. The first author stated that some of the data underlying the results in this article are no longer available. They provided files described as the original images raw images underlying some of the panels in the above figures, however not all appeared to match the published panels.
The first author stated that the PA700/S10B panels in Figs 2B and 3A are accidental duplicates of the OGT panel in Fig 3A, and they provided a replacement panel. They also stated that the β7 panel in Fig 2B is incorrect and provided a replacement. The replacement panel provided for β7 appears to partially overlap with the β7 panel in Fig 6C despite representing different conditions.
The first author stated that the PA700/S10B panels in Figs 2E and 3B are identical and represent the same conditions. They acknowledge that the reuse of the image should have been declared in the figure legends.
The first author provided versions of the western blots in Fig 6 showing more of the gels horizontally. These versions of the images raised additional concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data in Fig 6.
In light of the concerns affecting multiple figure panels that question the reliability of these data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

+Duplication of Image","The editors are retracting this article owing to issues that have come to our attention regarding the integrity of several images in the study. In November 2021, Nature Medicine was informed by The Ohio State University that a forensic analysis concluded that data in the shCtr/shEGFR panel (lines miR-30c to miR-101) and the shCtr/shMET panel (lines miR-548d to miR-203) of Figure 1b were identical. Further internal review of all the data in the study by the journal confirmed this finding and identified other instances in which images appear to be used in multiple figure panels, including the beta actin panels in Figure 1a, 1g and 1i, and the GAPDH panels in Figures 4b and 6g. The authors were contacted by the journal and the data they provided did not fully address the concerns raised. On the basis of editorial assessment of the available data, we are of the opinion that the extent of the inaccuracies in the figures undermines full confidence in the study.
The authors Michela Garofalo, Gianpiero Di Leva, Gerald Nuovo, Gerolama Condorelli, Stefano Volinia, Francisca Lovat, and Carlo M. Croce do not agree with this retraction.

+Unreliable Results
+Error in Cell Lines/Tissues","The authors retract this publication due to concerns about the cell lines employed in the study.
The study reports experiments looking at pathways involved in anoikis resistance in human adenoid cystic carcinoma; the experiments involved the use of the cell lines ACCM and ACC2. After the publication of the article, a reader raised concerns that these two cell lines may not originate from adenoid cystic carcinoma. The authors have completed a short tandem repeat analysis on the cell lines and this has revealed cross-contamination with other human cells, which compromises the relevance of the work to human adenoid cystic carcinoma, and thus the conclusions of the study.
In the light of this, the authors retract this publication.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","The above-cited article has been retracted by the American Diabetes Association, the publisher of Diabetes. This article was previously the subject of an expression of concern in the April 2016 issue of the journal (Diabetes 2016;65:1121–1122. DOI: 10.2337/db16-ec04. PMID: 27208021). As noted in the April 2016 expression of concern, the American Diabetes Association asked the corresponding author’s institution, the University of Campinas (São Paulo, Brazil), to investigate concerns related to the possible duplication of several images presented in this article.
The American Diabetes Association did not receive a response from the university, but the lead author of the article, who is also listed as a guarantor of the study, provided a point-by-point response to address the issues reported in the expression of concern. After reviewing the author’s response, the American Diabetes Association’s Panel on Ethical Scientific Programs (ESP) maintains that the following instances of potential duplication affect the overall reliability of the study:
The IB:Tub strip in Fig. 1B (LH) appears to have been previously published, with horizontal rotation, in the following article:
∘Rocha et al. Clin Cancer Res 2011;17:3993–4005. DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2243. PMID: 21543517 (Fig. 4D, IB:mTOR strip)
The IB:Tub strip in Fig. 1G (LH) appears to have been previously published, with horizontal rotation, in the following articles:
∘Ropelle et al. PLoS Biol 2010;8:e1000465. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000465. PMID: 20808781 (Fig. 8H, IB:α-tubulin, lanes 3–5)

In her response to the ESP, the lead author reported that the IB:Tub strip in Fig. 1G (LH) may have been republished in the following International Journal of Cardiology article and that the image was indeed republished in the following American Journal of Physiology - Endocrinology and Metabolism and Journal of Physiology articles:
∘Barbosa et al. Int J Cardiol 2013;167:2983–2988. DOI: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.08.050. PMID: 22989604 (Fig. 1B, IB:eNOS, lanes 3–5)

The IB:Tub strip in Fig. 6B (Arc) appears to have been previously published in the following articles:
∘Rocha et al. Clin Cancer Res 2011;17:3993–4005. DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2243. PMID: 21543517 (Fig. 4B, IB:p53, lanes 2–5)

The IB:Tub strip in Fig. 6B (PVN) appears to be a duplicate, with size and contrast adjustments, of the IB:pIRβTyr1162/1163 strip of Fig. 2A in the following 2010 PLOS Biology article:
∘Ropelle et al. PLoS Biol 2010;8:e1000465. DOI: 10.1371//journal.pbio.1000465. PMID: 20808781
Since the publication of the April 2016 expression of concern, the ESP has learned of additional issues involving this article. These issues have recently been reported to the lead author, the corresponding author, and the university:
Bands 1–4 and 6 of the IB:Tub strip in Fig. 1B (LH) appear to be duplicates, with horizontal rotation, of bands 2–5 and 7 of the IB:IR strip in Fig. 7C in the following 2011 article by Oliveira et al.:
∘Oliveira et al. Diabetes 2011;60:784-796. DOI: 10.2337/db09-1907. PMID: 27208023
In addition, this image appears to have been previously published, with horizontal rotation, as bands 3–8 in the Total Akt strip in Fig. 2I in the following 2009 article by Prada et al.:
∘Prada et al. Diabetes 2009;58:2910-2919. DOI: 10.2337/db08-0506. PMID: 19696185
On the basis of its review of the lead author’s response and the additional concerns described above, the ESP believes that the study as a whole is unreliable and that the only responsible course of action for updating the status of Diabetes 2013;62:137–148 is to issue a full retraction. The American Diabetes Association, the publisher of Diabetes, has approved the Panel’s recommendation.
Diabetes is a member journal of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) (publicationethics.org).

+Duplication of Image
+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised about results presented in Figs 4, 8, 9, and 10. Specifically, the following results appear more similar than would be expected from independent samples:
The Fig 4D Occludin panel and the Fig 10A β-actin panel.
Lanes 1–2 of the Fig 8A COX2 panel, lanes 1–2 of the Fig 8B COX2 panel, and lanes 1–2 of the Fig 8C COX2 panel.
Lanes 3–4 of the Fig 8A COX2 panel and lanes 3–4 of the Fig 8B COX2 panel.
The Fig 8A β-actin panel, the Fig 8B β-actin panel, the Fig 8C β-actin panel, and lanes 2–5 of the Fig 8D β-actin panel.
Lanes 4–5 and lanes 6–7 of the Fig 9A NF-κB panel.
Lanes 1–3 of the Fig 9A IκB panel and lanes 1–3 of the Fig 9B IκB panel.
Lanes 1–5 of the Fig 9B NF-κB panel and lanes 1–5 of the Fig 9C NF-κB panel.
Lanes 4–7 of the Fig 9B IκB panel and lanes 4–7 of the Fig 9C IκB panel.
Lanes 2–3 and lanes 4–5 of the Fig 10A NRF2 panel.
Lanes 1–5 and lanes 6–10 of the Fig 10C β-actin panel.
The corresponding author stated that the similarities between reference (housekeeping) protein blots are due to the stripping and re-probing of the same blot, and commented that some blot images were spliced to remove extra lanes and/or duplicate or triplicate samples from the panel.
The corresponding author provided image data to support the results presented in Figs 8A, 8B and 9A. The underlying data for Fig 8B confirm that the panel has been spliced, but the underlying data provided for Fig 8A and Fig 9A do not appear to match the published panels. Overall, the data did not resolve the concerns about these figures.
The corresponding author stated that the underlying data for other figures were provided to PLOS ONE in 2014 but are no longer available in the laboratory records. PLOS is unable to access the journal’s 2014 correspondence records for this case. We sincerely regret that this case was not resolved much sooner after the prior correspondence.
Although we have been unable to review the primary data for several figures of concern, the nature and extent of unresolved image data reporting concerns call into question the reliability of the article’s results and conclusions. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
EL did not agree with the retraction. MCD, AF, SD, AM, CG, YD, and ED either did not respond directly or could not be reached.

Specifically:
Fig 3A (left) Lamin A/C lanes 2–4 and Fig 3C (left) Lamin A/C panel appear to report the same data with aspect ratio adjusted.
Fig 3B (left) ATF6 lanes 3–5, Fig 3C (left) ATF6 panel, and Fig 3C (right) eIF2α panel appear to report the same data with aspect ratio adjusted.
Fig 3B (left) Lamin A/C lanes 1–4 and Fig 4D Lamin A/C panel appear to report the same data.
Fig 3A (right) eIF2α and Fig 3B (right) PERK appear to report the same data.
The Fig 3C β-actin panel and Fig 4C eIF2α panel were mislabeled and report data that do not correspond to the experiments and/or sample labels described in the figures and their legends.
The authors requested retraction of the article and stated that the underlying data for these results are not available.
In light of the above concerns, and in line with the institution’s recommendation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
SLe, GAF, FRP, SLa, RL, and MT agreed with the retraction, though SLe noted that she stands by the article’s findings. SLe, GAF, SLa, and MT apologize for the issues with the published article. IC and RS either could not be reached or did not respond directly.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about results reported in Figures 4 and 9.
Specifically:
Given the brightness/contrast levels of the western blot images and the vertical lines separating lanes, one cannot confirm the integrity of the images or clarify whether the lanes for each panel present data from the same blot and exposure. When levels are adjusted for Figure 9, it appears as though each band represents an isolated blot fragment overlaid on a white background.
In Figure 4C, the following bands appear similar:
Nuclear NFκB/p65 lane 2 (VEGF) and β-Actin lane 3 (VEGF/DMSO)
Nuclear NFκB/p65 lane 3 (VEGF/DMSO) and β-Actin lane 5 (VEGF/SN50)
Nuclear NFκB/p65 lane 4 (VEGF/SN50M) and β-Actin lane 4 (VEGF/SN50M)
In Figure 9B, the following bands appear similar:
NFκB/p65 lane 2 (VEGF-Treated), SDF-1α lane 3 (DMSO-Treated), CXCR4 lane 2 (VEGF-Treated), FAK lane 2 (VEGF-Treated)
SDF-1α lane 2 (VEGF-Treated) and NFκB/p65 lane 3 (DMSO-Treated), when flipped vertically
CXCR4 lane 3 (DMSO-Treated) and FAK lane 3 (DMSO-Treated)
EPO lane 4 (YC-1-Treated) and ET-1 lane 3 (DMSO-Treated)
The authors were unable to resolve these issues or provide the original data underlying the results in response to journal queries. Without the original data we cannot resolve the above concerns which call into question the integrity of the images and the validity of the reported results.
In light of these concerns, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
Per FHAM and FAAM, the underlying data for this study were held by MD for whom current contact information is not available. The journal has not received confirmation that MD received communications about this case.
FHAM and FAAM replied to our notification but did not specify agreement or disagreement with the retraction. The other authors either could not be reached or did not reply.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about results reported in Figs 1 and 6.
Specifically:
The following panels in Fig 1A appear to report overlapping data:
○
37 and 39 degree panels for HepG2
○
37 and 39 degree panels for Huh7
Similarities were noted between Tubulin data reported in Fig 1B (HepG2 panel, lanes 2–5) and Fig 6C (lanes 1–4). The similar lanes represent samples exposed to different experimental conditions.
The corresponding authors commented that the invasion results for HepG2 and Huh7 cells were highly similar in the 37 and 39 degree groups. The original data underlying the results reported in Fig 1A are no longer available.
The authors provided available image data to support the results reported in Figs 1B and 6C, but these data did not resolve the concerns. The MMP-2, MMP-9, and Tubulin data reported in Fig 6C appear to match image data provided in support of Fig 1B, albeit with different blot and lane labels, suggesting that all three panels of Fig 6 may have reported the wrong data. None of the image data provided appear to match the results reported in Fig 1B. The authors commented that no additional western blot data are available currently.
In light of the unresolved concerns, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
LY, JZ and WL agreed with retraction and apologize for the issues with the published article. The other authors either could not be reached or did not respond directly.

+Error in Image","At the request of the authors, PLOS Pathogens is retracting this publication following an investigation into concerns about the origin and assembly of Figure 6 and a mounting mistake in Figure 1B.
The Northern blot depicted in Figure 6 contains several band duplications affecting the panels labelled 'IP@HA' and 'total RNA'. The figure was provided by Patrice Dunoyer during revision and was extracted from the Master thesis of a former student working under his supervision, without the prior consultation or consent of this student. The other authors of Sansregret et al. were not informed about the origin of this figure and, regrettably, its erroneous content escaped their attention both at the final revision and proofreading stages.
During inspection of the original blots, we realised that the loading control of Figure 1B was not the correct one; we have found the cognate one and the loadings are comparable. Importantly, the cross-reacting band visible on Figure 1B also provides an internal loading control. This mistake was made by co-authors Raphael Sansregret and Kamal Bouarab.
Further analysis of the raw material underlying the results depicted in Figure 6 was found to support the original conclusions drawn from it. The other conclusions of the published article also remain valid. However, given the nature and extent of data manipulation in Figure 6, the authors have collectively decided to retract the study.
All authors concur with this statement and apologise for not having detected these errors. Kamal Bouarab and Olivier Voinnet, as the corresponding authors, take full responsibility for the publication of this erroneous paper and regret deeply the inconvenience caused.

The Publisher and Editor regretfully retract this article [1] because the peer-review process was inappropriately influenced and compromised. As a result, the scientific integrity of the article cannot be guaranteed. A systematic and detailed investigation suggests that a third party was involved in supplying fabricated details of potential peer reviewers for a large number of manuscripts submitted to different journals. In accordance with recommendations from COPE we have retracted all affected published articles, including this one. It was not possible to determine beyond doubt that the authors of this particular article were aware of any third party attempts to manipulate peer review of their manuscript.

+Duplication of Image
+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns have been raised regarding the immunoblotting data presented in Fig 3A as well as the immunocytochemistry data presented in Fig 5A.
Specifically,
In Fig 3A, the bands in Oct3/4 panel 10 nM DHT treated LNCaP cells (lanes 9–12) appear similar to the bands in Nanog panel 0 nM DHT treated LNCaP cells (lanes 1–4).
In Fig 3A, the bands in GADPH panel 1 nM DHT treated LNCaP cells (lanes 5–8) appear similar to the bands in GADPH panel 1nM DHT treated PC-3 cells (lanes 5–8).
In Fig 5A, the panel representing immunocytochemical staining of 0 nM DHT treated LNCaP cells appears similar to the panel representing immunocytochemical staining of 0 nM DHT treated PC-3 cells.
The Commission on Research Integrity at Oslo University Hospital and Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo completed an investigation and confirmed the concerns with Fig 3A and Fig 5A.
The authors indicated that the wrong images have been uploaded for the Nanog panel of the 0 nM DHT treated LNCaP cells, and the GAPDH panel of the 1 nM DHT treated PC-3 cells presented in Fig 3A. Furthermore, the authors indicated that the wrong images have been used for the 0 nM DHT treated LNCaP and PC-3 cells presented in Fig 5A. The authors offered replacement images for the panels of concern and provided supporting data for some of the results reported in the article. However, data were not provided in support of all panels for the experiments in question, and discrepancies were noted between the supporting image provided and the published figure for the Nanog panel of the 0 nM DHT treated PC-3 cells in Fig 3A.
Overall, the data and information provided by the authors have not fully resolved the concerns. Given the remaining issues for Fig 3A and the data shown in the figure, the article’s claims based on the western blot results in this figure are not adequately supported.
In light of the above concerns and in line with the institution’s recommendation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
GW, KA, UA, and ZZ agreed with the retraction. DL and ZS did not confirm agreement or disagreement with the retraction decision. YM, JGW, ES, TS, LV, EP, YY, GK, and JMN either did not respond directly or could not be reached. JL did not agree with the retraction.

Similarities were noted between bands within the β-actin panel, which also appears to duplicate the β-actin panel in Figure 2 of [2].
Additionally, the HSP 27 blots appear to have been altered during figure preparation, based on background discontinuities above and below lanes 3,4 in the upper (non-labor) panel and above lanes 5–7 of the middle (labor) panel.
The University of Glasgow investigated these concerns and recommended retraction owing to signs of data manipulation and falsification. In the course of the investigation, it was established that the original data underlying the figure panels in question are no longer available.
In light of these concerns, and in line with the institution’s communication, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article, as the concerns raised call into question the integrity of the data and validity of the article’s results and conclusions.

+Ethical Violations by Author","Concerns have been raised that the transplants performed in the local context at the time of procedures reported in this article [1] may have involved organs/tissues procured from prisoners [2].
Details as to the donor sources and methods of obtaining informed consent from donors were not reported in [1], and the authors did not reply to journal queries seeking to clarify these issues and the cause(s) of donor death. International ethics standards call for transparency in organ donor and transplantation programs and clear informed consent procedures including considerations to ensure that donors are not subject to coercion.
In addition, the authors did not provide documentation when requested by the journal to confirm that the study had institutional ethics approval, and they did not respond to inquiries about the availability of underlying data supporting this study.
Owing to the lack of documentation to demonstrate this study had prospective ethical approval, insufficient reporting, unresolved concerns around the source of transplanted organs and whether they included organs from prisoners, and in compliance with international ethical standards for organ/tissue donation and transplantation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The authors did not respond to the retraction notification.

Specifically:
The Mock-infected panel of Fig 2A in [1] appears similar to the Mock-infected panel of Fig 3A in [2]. The authors confirmed that they used the same image to represent the mock-control in both publications. They stated that the same DF1 cells were used as a control for both of the experiments, and that per their observations there is little difference in batch-to-batch results for mock-infected DF1 cells.
There to be a vertical discontinuity separating the lanes 1–4 from lane 5 in the top panel of Fig 3A. The authors attributed this to a smiling effect due to the voltage setting used during electrophoresis and commented that the data were obtained from a single SDS-PAGE gel.
The authors noted that the original data underlying the results reported in this article are no longer available. There are seven instances where the Results section refers to data not shown; the data underlying those statements are likewise not available.
This article was included in an investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which concluded there was evidence of research misconduct in the case of the first issue described above [3].
In light of the above concerns, the unavailability of the original data, and the outcome of the HHS investigation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","After this article [1] was published, concerns were raised about results reported in Fig 1.
Specifically:
The following lanes appear similar:
○
Day 0 lanes for Animals #2, 3 in the rAPMV-4 panels
○
Day 0 data reported for Animal #1, rAPMV-4, appear to match the image data for Day 0, Animal #4, rAPMV-4/Fc-BC. This issue was confirmed in the University of Maryland’s investigation of this work.
○
Day 0 lanes for Animals #1, 2, 3, 4 in WtAPMV-7 panel and Animals #1, 2, 3, 4 in the rAPMV-7/Fcs-5B panel
○
Day 28 data for Animals #1 and #3 in the WtAPMV-7 panel
There appear to be vertical discontinuities suggestive of image splicing between lanes in all panels of Fig 1.
Concerns were raised about controls and aspects of the experimental design for the Fig 1 results. No loading control data or pre-immune/no antibody control blots were reported to support the western blot results in Fig 1. Furthermore, the authors explained that virus samples for each of the APMV strains were run together on the same blot; the membranes were cut into individual strips and incubated individually with Day 0 or Day 28 sera from each monkey; after blot development by chemiluminescence, figures were generated by compiling data obtained on multiple blot strips. This image splicing was not declared in the figure legend, and the validity of comparisons between Day 0 and Day 28 results is in question since results were obtained using different blot strips and no loading control data were reported.
The authors commented that Day 0 data looked similar across experiments and that the same control data were reused to represent different results due to errors in figure assembly. Regarding the Day 28 results (Animals #1 and #3 in the WtAPMV-7), the authors stated that the original results for these animals appear similar but they stand by these results as reported in the figure.
The University of Maryland investigated this work and confirmed that several lanes are duplicated in this figure, including control (Day 0) lanes in several panels and the two Day 28 lanes in the WtAPMV-7 panel.
Raw image data were provided in support of Fig 1. The image data supported the Day 28 results reported in most panels of the figure. The Day 0 data did not match the results in the figure in most cases, and for some control lanes we were unable to confirm verifiable image content. Overall, the issues about experimental controls and Day 28 results for WtAPMV-7 were not resolved, and we remain concerned about the extent of image data reuse in the published figure.
In light of the above concerns, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
UJB agreed with retraction. SKK, SKS, and PLC did not agree with retraction and stand by the article’s findings. PLC apologizes for the issues with the article. The other authors either could not be reached or did not respond directly.

One part of the study involves an assessment of the effects of NDRG2 on the expression of pVHL, HIF-1α and VEGF in 786-O cells. After the publication of the article, a reader raised concerns that the human renal cancer cell lines 786-O and A498 used in the study lack HIF-1α. In addition the cell line 786-O has been reported to be VHL negative. The authors have completed a short tandem repeat analysis on the cell lines and this has revealed cross-contamination, which compromises the relevance of the work to renal cell carcinoma, and thus the conclusions of the study.
In the light of this, the authors retract this publication.

+Manipulation of Images
+Duplication of Image","After publication of this article [1], concerns were raised about results reported in several figures.
Similarities were noted between western blot data reported in Figs 1B and 4A:
Fig 1B ST6GalI lanes 4 (horizontally flipped) and 6 and Fig 4A p-Akt 308 lane 3
Fig 1B ST6GalI lane 5 and Fig 4A p-Akt 308 lane 2
Fig 1B ST6GalII lanes 4–6 and Fig 4A Akt lanes 1–3
In Fig 2B, there appears to be a vertical discontinuity after lane 2 of the GAPDH panel. The authors confirmed that they combined data from two blot fragments in this figure.
The authors provided image files and replication data in support of the above figures but these did not fully resolve the concerns.
In addition, several immunohistochemistry panels in in Figs 2E, 3E, and 5D that represent different experiments appear to show overlapping fields of the same data. (Panel numbers indicate columns in the figures, numbered from left to right.)
Fig 2E ST6GalI panel 1 (lower right quadrant) appears similar to panel 2 (upper left quadrant).
Fig 2E ST6GalI panel 2 is similar to Fig 5D PI3K p110α panel 1.
For Fig 3E, the right edge of panel 1 and the left edge panel 2 are highly similar.
There appears to be overlap between images shown in Fig 3E panel 3, Fig 5D p-Akt 308 panel 1, and Fig 5D p-Akt 473 panel 1.
Similarities were noted in Fig 5D for p-Akt 473 panel 1 and Akt panels 2 and 3.
In Fig 5D, the upper region of panel 2 for p-Akt 308 is similar to the lower region of panel 4 for Akt. The lower region of p-Akt 308 panel 2 appears to overlap with the upper region of NF-κB panel 4.
In Fig 5D, similarities were noted between panel 2 for p-Akt 308 and panel 4 for NF-κB.
In Fig 5D, there appears to be overlap between the images shown in p-Akt 473 panel 1, Akt panel 2, and Akt panel 3.
The authors commented that errors were made when preparing these figures and they provided updated versions in which the panels in question were replaced. However, the extent of duplications within and across figures calls into question the overall reliability of the results.
In light of the above concerns, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The corresponding author (JL) apologized for the issues with the published article and notified the journal that all authors agreed with the retraction. The other authors either could not be reached or did not respond directly.

Fig 1B, the HCV NS5A panel lanes 4–7 appear similar to Fig 3C panel HCV core lanes 2–5 in a 2010 Journal of General Virology article [2], Fig 1A ASC panel in a 2016 Journal of Biological Chemistry article [5] and Fig 7B Albumin panel in a PLOS ONE article by the same authors [6]. The 2016 Journal of Biological Chemistry article has been withdrawn [7] and the PLOS ONE article has been retracted [8].
In discussing this matter, the authors notified the journal that Fig 2A, Huh7.5+NS5A panel is incorrect. This panel appears similar to Fig 7E Huh7.5+NS5A in a 2013 Journal of Biological Chemistry article [3] by the same authors which has been withdrawn [4].
The authors have provided image data for Fig 1B as well as replacement images for Figs 1B and 2A which represent replication experiments. However, these data did not resolve the potential image reuse across publications.
The original image underlying published Fig 2A is unavailable, however all other primary data underlying the figures are available from the authors. Given the unresolved concerns surrounding Figs 1B and 2A as well as repeated re-use of these images in multiple publications that call into question the validity of the study findings, the PLOS ONE editors retract this article.
GW did not agree with retraction. JI, SM, TM, KB, and MSD did not respond.
Owing to the concerns about similarities with previously published content [2–5, 7] that is not licensed for reproduction and distribution under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, Fig 1B HCV NS5A panel, Fig 2A Huh7.5+NS5A panel have been removed from the retracted article [1].

+Concerns/Issues About Data","The Journal and Authors retract the 4 February 2014 article cited above for the following reasons provided by the Authors:
After publication of this article, we became aware that the transgenic plants described in this manuscript were not correct because of inadvertent errors in genotyping of the parent plants, and thus the results presented in Figures 4, 6 are not valid. We realized from the immunoblot result presented in Figure 4B, that immunoprecipitated BAK1-ΔCT-Flag had the same apparent molecular weight as did BAK1-Flag, despite the fact that truncated protein should have been ~4-kDa smaller but that size difference was not apparent. We subsequently confirmed that the BAK1 construct used was not truncated but was full length. At the moment we cannot explain why the transgenic plants show reduced growth, but it is clear that it is not related to the BAK1 transgene. However, the results presented in Figures 1–3, 5 with recombinant proteins in vitro are valid, and thus conclusions drawn from functional and interaction studies in vitro are correct. Regrettably, the relevance to the function of BAK1 in vivo remains uncertain and it is no longer clear whether the carboxy-terminus of BAK1 is “required for normal growth of Arabidopsis” as stated in the title. The responsibility for this experimental error rests with only two of the authors: the senior author (MHO) who was a Senior Research Scientist when these studies were conducted with extensive experience in molecular biology and whose primary responsibility was production of the transgenic plants. The other responsible individual was the corresponding author (SCH), who failed to provide adequate oversight to the production of the transgenic plants and as a result, critical checks and balances were not in place. The other authors (WX, SYK, XW, and SDC) are not responsible in any way for this regrettable situation. We are pursuing follow-up experiments to correctly generate the BAK1-ΔCT-Flag transgenic plants in the bak1 bkk1 double null background that are required to test the functional role in vivo and hope to publish soon.
We sincerely regret any scientific misconceptions that have been caused by the above paper; the corresponding author's laboratory wasted an additional year studying these plants before the error was discovered. We apologize to the entire scientific community for the misinformation and any adverse consequences that may have resulted.",,"['Data', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error in Data', 'Error in Methods', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Unreliable Data', 'Unreliable Results']","['Data', 'Methods', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'Unreliable Data', 'Unreliable Results']","['Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results']","['Concern/Issues about Article', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Error by Journal/Publisher', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results']","['Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process']","['Error in Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Retract and Replace']",[],[],[],[]

Based on the report of an inquiry conducted by Wayne State University and additional analysis conducted by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) [2], the ORI informed the journal that the first author Dr Teresita L. Briones engaged in research misconduct by falsifying and/or fabricating data by falsely reporting the results of western blot experiments and that data reported in Figures 2A and 2C in [1] were duplicated, reused and falsely relabelled, and claimed to represent different experiments. We have not been able to contact any of the authors.

+Concerns/Issues About Image
+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figures 2, 7, 9, and 10. Specifically,
In Figure 2C there appear to be repetitive elements within and between the control panel and the scrambled shRNA panel.
In Figure 7A, there appear to be repetitive elements within the following panels:
Vector 0h
Scrambled shRNA 0h
shRNA 0h
The Figure 9B β-actin panels appear similar, despite being used to represent different samples (total protein, cytosolic extract, and nuclear extract).
Figure 10, there appear to be repetitive elements within and between the lanes presented in this blot.
The authors provided underlying data and replacement images for the Figure 2C, 7A, and 9B results, but disagreed with the concerns raised with Figure 10, stating that there are differences between the lanes and that the level of similarity is normal and reasonable. The data provided for editorial review did not resolve the above concerns.
In light of the concerns affecting multiple figure panels that question the integrity of these data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
LL, TL, HY, CW, and YL did not agree with the retraction and stand by the article’s findings. FZ and JL either did not respond directly or could not be reached.

+Ethical Violations by Author
+Concerns/Issues About Data","Concerns have been raised that the transplants performed in the local context at the time of procedures reported in this article [1] may have involved organs/tissues procured from prisoners [2].
Details as to the donor sources and methods of obtaining informed consent from donors were not reported in [1], and when following up on these concerns the authors did not clarify these issues or the cause(s) of donor death in response to journal inquiries. International ethics standards call for transparency in organ donor and transplantation programs and clear informed consent procedures including considerations to ensure that donors are not subject to coercion.
In addition, the authors did not provide documentation when requested by the journal to confirm that the study had institutional ethics approval, and the authors did not respond to inquiries about the availability of underlying data supporting this study.
Owing to the lack of documentation to demonstrate that this study had prospective ethical approval, insufficient reporting, unresolved concerns around the source of transplanted organs and whether they included organs from prisoners, and in compliance with international ethical standards for organ/tissue donation and transplantation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The first author and corresponding author notified the journal that all authors disagree with the retraction. The other authors either could not be reached or did not respond directly.

The Editor-in-Chief and Publisher have retracted this article [1] because the scientific integrity of the content cannot be guaranteed. An investigation by the Publisher found it to be one of a group of articles we have identified as showing evidence suggestive of attempts to subvert the peer review and publication system to inappropriately obtain or allocate authorship. This article showed evidence of plagiarism (most notably from the article cited [2]) and peer review and authorship manipulation.

The Editor-in-Chief and Publisher have retracted this article [1] because the scientific integrity of the content cannot be guaranteed. An investigation by the Publisher found it to be one of a group of articles we have identified as showing evidence suggestive of attempts to subvert the peer review and publication system to inappropriately obtain or allocate authorship. This article showed evidence of plagiarism (most notably from the articles cited [2–7]) and peer review and authorship manipulation.

+Investigation by Journal/Publisher
+Duplication of Image","Following the publication of this article [1], similarities were noted between this article and articles submitted by other research groups, including [2–10], of which one article [10] was previously retracted [11].
Similarities included the following figures, which appear to fully or partially overlap, despite being published in different articles and representing different conditions:
inhibitor panel in Fig 3E of [1] and miR-217-mimic panel in Fig 2D of [5].
pCDNA-PAQR3 scamble panel in Fig 5E of [1] and the BRD7 panel in Fig 5D of [7] in grayscale.
PAQR3 panel in Fig 4D of [1], L1CAM panel in Fig 4D of [4], WASF3 panel in Fig 3D of [5], and BRD7 panel in Fig 4C of [7].
Lanes 1–2 of the GAPDH panel in Fig 4D of [1], and lanes 2–3 of the GAPDH panel in Fig 3D of [6].
Although the corresponding author initially replied to acknowledge receipt of our message, PLOS ONE did not receive responses to the queries regarding these concerns by the end of the original deadline and extension.
The unresolved concerns call into question the validity and provenance of the reported results, and the adherence of this article to the PLOS Authorship policy. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article [1].
All authors did not comment on the retraction decision, did not respond directly or could not be reached.

+Duplication of Image","The authors and editors retract this publication [1] following an investigation into concerns around the images presented in several figures. After the publication of this article, readers raised concerns about Figures 1E, 2E-F, and 3A. Specifically,
In Figure 1E, there are similarities between the first and third lane within the panel.
There are similarities in bands between the gels displayed in Figures 2E and 2F.
In Figure 3A, there are areas of duplication in images within the third panel.
The concerns were brought to the attention of the authors, who provided replicate images of the same experimental sets but were not able to provide the images underlying the figures included in the article.
An institutional investigation conducted by The Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur confirmed the duplication of images and recommended the retraction of the article.
The preparation of the figures falls below the standard of publication; in light of these concerns and in line with the institutional recommendation, the authors and the editors retract this publication.
The authors sincerely apologize to the scientific community for the errors in the published article.

+Falsification/Fabrication of Data","This article (published in volume 54, issue 1, pages 25–37) has been retracted at the request of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), with the knowledge and consent of the authors.
The request for this retraction was received on 7 December 2020.
The retraction follows the conclusion of an OUHSC investigation that ‘determined that the first author, Dr Jun Zhou, carried out knowing and intentional falsification of multiple Western blot figures’ and that ‘significant falsification of data in multiple figures invalidate the scientific findings and conclusions of this article’.
The editors of the Journal of Molecular Endocrinology were first made aware of concerns about the article in June 2019.

Following publication, concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding the figures. Some stained tissue pictures in Figure 6 [1] are duplicates, appearing in Figure 4A of another published paper [2]. The figure duplication brings uncertainty regarding the scientific conclusions. Therefore this paper [1] is retracted and shall be marked accordingly.
We apologize to our readership that this went undetected until now.

The Editors were first alerted in early 2020 that the bands in Figure 4C show unusual levels of similarity. The journal and institution investigated the matter at the time and did not find conclusive evidence to support the allegations.
When similar allegations were brought to the Editors’ attention again in late 2021, the journal re-opened the investigation. With newer techniques, the journal also identified potential concerns with Figure 2D. While the corresponding author works with the institution where the research was conducted to retrieve the original data, the Editors advise readers to examine the details of this study with particular care.

They explained that they had re-reviewed the data for the study and found that some patients whose data were used had a diagnosis of spinal spondylitis rather than spinal tuberculosis. The authors did not respond to the journal’s follow-up questions to provide further clarification on the diagnosis and treatment of the participants and how the errors affected the analysis reported in the article. Without these further clarifications, it remains unclear whether the overall results and conclusions reported in the article are reliable.
In addition, the authors did not respond to the journal’s post-publication requests for ethics approval documentation or for information about the availability of the underlying data for the study. The Data Availability Statement for the article says, ""Relevant data are within the paper,"" but the underlying data are not included in the article.
The PLOS ONE Editors retract this article as these unresolved issues have implications for the reliability of the results and adherence of the article to the journal’s ethics standards and Data Availability policy.
Fig 3 of the published article [1] was replaced at the time of retraction to address an error in the figure.
The authors did not respond to the retraction decision.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Concerns have been raised that the transplants performed in the local context at the time of procedures reported in this article [1] may have involved organs/tissues procured from prisoners [2].
The Ethics Statement of [1], declares, “None of the transplant donors were from a vulnerable population and all donors gave their consent freely.” However, the authors did not provide ethics approval documentation or consent forms when requested by the journal to support their claims, confirm that the study had institutional ethics approval, and clarify whether organs had been procured from prisoners. Details as to the donor sources and methods of obtaining informed consent from donors were not reported in [1], and the authors did not respond to the journal’s queries to clarify these issues or the cause(s) of donor death. International ethics standards call for transparency in organ donor and transplantation programs and clear informed consent procedures including considerations to ensure that donors are not subject to coercion.
In addition, the authors did not provide the primary data underlying their article and as such, did not comply with the PLOS Data Availability Policy.
Owing to the lack of documentation to demonstrate this study had prospective ethical approval, insufficient reporting, unresolved concerns around the source of transplanted organs and whether they included organs from prisoners, and in compliance with international ethical standards for organ/tissue donation and transplantation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
The authors did not respond to the retraction decision.

At the authors request, the Editor and Publisher of Vascular Health and Risk Management wish to retract the published article. On review of the data the authors found the wrong sized cuffs had been used to measure the blood pressure of participants due to a misunderstanding of the user manual. The researchers used ‘standard’ and ‘large’ cuffs where ‘small adult’ cuffs should have been used instead. It is known that using oversized cuffs can underestimate blood pressure up to 30 mmHg and while the results appeared appropriate the authors doubt the accuracy of their results and believe their findings are invalid. In addition, the authors found a partial lack of patient signatures on some of the informed consent forms. In order to maintain the standards of scientific research integrity the authors have requested to retract their article.
The authors wish to apologise for this error.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figs 3C and 4D, and with some of the cell lines reported in this study. Specifically,
In Fig 3D, the 5th and the 7th tumour presented for the control group appear similar.
In Fig 4D, the 6th tumour presented for the control group appears similar to the 3rd tumour presented for the Lv-let-7c group.
After the publication of this article [1], the cell line HepG2(no.HB-8065) reported in this study as being a Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, has been identified as a misclassified hepatoblastoma cell line instead [2, 3].
After the publication of this article [1], the cell line SMMC-7721 reported in this study as being a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, has been identified as a contaminated HeLa derivative cell line instead [4, 5, 6].
After the publication of this article [1], the cell line L-02 reported in this study as being a human immortalized liver cell line has been identified as a contaminated HeLa derivative cell line instead [6, 7].
The first author states that images were inadvertently duplicated during the preparation of the Fig 3C and Fig 4D results, and provided underlying data for the Fig 3 results. The first author stated that they were unable to provide a correct image for the incorrect Fig 4D Lv-let-7c panel because the tumour was so small (weighing only 0.01g) that no photo was taken. In light of the missing data, this issue cannot be fully resolved.
The first author comments that they do not agree that the cell lines are contaminated, stating that the HepG2(no.HB-8065) was obtained from ATCC [8], which indicated that “Hep G2 [HEPG2] is a cell line exhibiting epithelial-like morphology that was isolated from a hepatocellular carcinoma of a 15-year-old, White, male youth with liver cancer.”, and that the SMMC-7721 and L-02 cell lines were obtained from the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of Chinese Academy of Sciences, which provided cell line STR certificates when the cell lines were purchased. The STR certificates have not been shared with the journal for editorial review.
The authors provided individual level data underlying the Fig 4ABC results, as well as underlying data for the Western blots presented in Figs 5C, 6ABC, and Fig 7A, however not all underlying images provided shows uncropped and unaltered blots as requested by the journal. The individual level data underlying the Fig 3B results are no longer available. The first author states that all remaining underlying data remain available upon request.
In light of the concerns pertaining to the use of misidentified and contaminated cell lines, which affect the reliability of the published results and conclusions, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

The Editor-in-Chief and Publisher have retracted this article [1] because the scientific integrity of the content cannot be guaranteed. An investigation by the Publisher found it to be one of a group of articles we have identified as showing evidence suggestive of attempts to subvert the peer review and publication system to inappropriately obtain or allocate authorship. This article showed evidence of plagiarism (most notably from the articles cited [2–5]) and authorship manipulation.

The Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of International Journal of Nanomedicine wish to retract the published article.
Concerns were raised about the possibility of image manipulation and duplication in the published article. The alleged image manipulation relates to the Western blot bands presented in:
Figure 6A p-NF-κB and p-IκB-α
Figure 6A, Figure S3A and S3C β-actin bands
Figure S3C Bax and Bcl-2
It was also found that images in Figure 4 (TF-NP + CDDP; EGCG + CDDP and EGCG-NP + CDDP) were duplicated from images presented in Figure 5 of the article:

The authors were contacted but were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged image duplication and could not supply satisfactory revisions for the article. The Director of CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (CSIR-IITR) was contacted and was very helpful throughout our investigation. The Editor-in-Chief determined the findings and conclusions presented in the study were no longer supported.

The Editors have retracted this Article.
After publication, concerns were raised with respect to some of the data reported. Specifically:
- In Figure 2 the panels ii and iv of (B) and the ERβ and PCNA slides in row ii of (C) appear to contain internal duplications;
- The GAPDH loading controls in Figure 2D and Figure 6 appear to be the same.
The Authors provided original data files for all figures except Figure 6. Examination of the files for Figure 2B and 2C could not exclude that the duplications were image acquisition artefacts. However, when the original data files for Figure 1D and 2D were examined evidence of the removal of background noise and non-specific signal was apparent, in violation of the Journal’s policy on digital integrity and standards.
The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the data presented.

In the above article, we presented evidence that temperature phase shifts animal circadian clocks through regulated degradation of critical circadian pacemaker proteins mediated by calcium and SOL protease. In follow-up experiments, other members of the corresponding author’s laboratory were unable to reproduce key observations made in vivo that supported the role of calcium and SOL protease in signaling temperature input to the Drosophila circadian clock. An in-depth review of the dataset generated by the first author revealed clear evidence that he had repeatedly misrepresented and altered primary data pertaining to the role of calcium, calmodulin, and SOL protease in Drosophila during the study. An independent investigation conducted by the University of Massachusetts Medical School concluded that the first author committed scientific misconduct. Since the manipulated data—which measured the amplitude of circadian phase shifts in response to temperature pulses in various genotypes using luciferase and behavioral assays—were critical to support our conclusions, we are retracting the above article. We sincerely apologize to the scientific community for publishing this erroneous article and profoundly regret any inconvenience and confusion that it might have caused.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","PPAR Research has retracted the article titled “ ” [1] due to errors found in the scientific content of the article. We consulted our Editorial Board who believed that myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) for only 24 hours should not induce an increase in the heart weight-to-body weight ratio because cardiac hypertrophy takes 1-2 weeks, though the authors argued that the increase was due to an inflammatory response, which disappears after 2-3 days. The board queried what is meant when a 100% infarct area/total area ratio is reported for IR hearts, when the tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining in Figure 1 shows a small area of infarct: the authors explained that the infarct size was normalized to the IR group as 100%. The TTC images are of low technical quality: some hearts have 8 slices and others have 10, making the results difficult to analyze. The infarcts in all groups are minor and TTC staining is minimal; many of the hearts have little ischemic injury and the board found the normalization misleading. Although the authors provided the underlying data and images, the board recommended retraction. The authors disagree with this decision.
For the Western blot results, the board argued that PPARalpha antibodies are difficult to use and robust results are surprising; the authors said they tested the specificity. The interaction of a cytosolic protein cyclophilin D with PPARalpha, a nuclear protein, is possible but does not make sense for the proposed mechanism. The identity of the band said to be PPARalpha is questionable: the phosphorylated PPARalpha is from a different blot (and thus a different sample) than the total PPARalpha and the GAPDH control. The AMPK blots have the same problem. Some of the images do not correspond to the underlying images.
The quantification of the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) is questionable: the IgG lane is spliced into the image. As with the Western blots, using the PPARalpha antibody in this immunoprecipitation should have been quite difficult. The authors said Co-IP was performed using a “reverse approach”: IP with PPARalpha antibody followed by immunoblotting with CyP-D antibody and vice versa; IP with CyP-D antibody followed by immunoblotting with PPARalpha antibody.
The echocardiographic function data provided is incomplete: many parameters are shown in some mice, but not others. Ejection fraction values are given, but the volume measures needed to calculate this are not. There are several errors in the standard error calculations, because the “n” includes animals that were not assessed for the given parameters.
Finally, the board found it surprising that calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling was largely blocked in the drug-treated group.

Dear editor,
As corresponding author I ask for retraction of our article Finelli et al. (2016[1]) with the consent of all co-authors, because of unauthorized reproduction of confidential content of another manuscript. The data in the retracted article actually are from a cohort of patients from the Boston, MA enrolled in a trial registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02454127. We deeply regret these circumstances and apologize to the scientific community.

+Concerns/Issues About Data","Concerns have been raised that the transplants performed in the local context of procedures reported in this article [1] may have involved organs/tissues procured from prisoners [2]. International ethics standards call for transparency in organ donor and transplantation programs and clear informed consent procedures including considerations to ensure that donors are not subject to coercion.
Details as to the transplant donor sources and methods of obtaining informed consent from donors were not reported in [1]. The authors did not clarify these issues or the cause(s) of donor death in response to journal queries, although they provided ethics approval documentation and informed consent forms for organ donors. The first author claimed that the authors were not involved with organ donation or surgical procedures and noted that this study focused on transplant recipients. The Ethics Statement of [1] declared that patients provided informed written consent, and stated, “No conflict of interest during all organ transplantations. No organ trafficking involved.” The ethics approval document provided (S1 Fig in [1]) was dated after the onset of participant recruitment and it indicated that the ethics review and approval did not include consideration of an informed consent form. Furthermore, while the ethics document indicated that no organ trafficking was involved it did not clarify donor sources or whether organs had been procured from prisoners.
The authors did not provide the primary data underlying this article’s results and as such the article does not comply with the PLOS Data Availability Policy.
Owing to the above concerns, and in line with international ethics standards for organ/tissue donation and transplantation, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.

+Author Unresponsive","BioMed Research International has retracted the article titled “High Expression of PTGR1 Promotes NSCLC Cell Growth via Positive Regulation of Cyclin-Dependent Protein Kinase Complex” [1]. A series of very similar articles on shRNA and cancer cell lines was identified by Byrne and Labbé [2], and the intertextual distance between this article and an article in the series [3] is lower than expected by chance. The following concerns were found:
The supposed nontargeting control shRNA sequence, 5 GCGGAGGGTTTGAAAGAATATCTCGAGATATTCTTTCAAACCCTCCGCTTTTTT-3, targets TPD52L2 (NM_199360). The same sequence was used as a nontargeting control in other articles identified by Byrne and Labbé.
The article is very similar in methods and structure to two other studies that also use this incorrect sequence [4, 5].
The authors did not respond to requests for comment.

The editors retract this article.
It was brought to the editors’ attention that multiple figures in this article overlap with a paper entitled “Resveratrol rescues hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction via activation of Akt” which was published in Acta Pharmacologica Sinica in December 20161.
Specifically, four subpanels in Figure 1B in this article are identical to Figures 1A and 1B in Ref 1. One subpanel in Figure 1E in this article is identical to a subpanel in Figure 1D in Ref 1. Four subpanels in Figure 2A in this article are identical to Figure 2A in Ref 1. Two subpanels in Figure 3B in this article are identical to Figure 3A in Ref 1. Two subpanels in Figure 3C in this article are identical to Figure 3B in Ref 1. Figures 2C, 2D, 4A, 4B, and 4C are identical between both articles. Figures 6A, 6B, 6C, and 6D in this article are identical to Figures 5A, 5C, 5D, and 5F, respectively, in Ref 1. Finally, Figure 8A in this article is identical to Figure 6B in Ref 1.
The editors requested the raw data from the authors, but received no response. The editors then liaised with the institution to obtain current contact information for the authors and were able to contact two of the three authors, who both confirmed that they were not aware of this submission.
Since the underlying raw data is not available, we are unable to establish that this work was carried out as presented. Additionally, the submission to the journal without the knowledge of two of the authors was in breach of Nature Research editorial policies. Taking all of this into account, the editors decided to retract this article.

+Concerns/Issues About Image
+Concerns/Issues About Data","Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figs 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
Specifically:
The following panels appear similar:
○ The Fig 2A Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex β-actin panels and the Fig 2C Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex β-actin panels respectively.
○ The Fig 5A Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex TrkB panels and the Fig 6A Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex TrkB panels respectively.
○ The Fig 9A Hippocampus β-actin panel and the Fig 11A Hippocampus β-actin panel.
○ The Fig 10A Prefrontal cortex β-actin panel and the Fig 11B Prefrontal cortex β-actin panel.
When levels are adjusted to visualize background, the following panels appear to partially overlap:
○ The Fig 1B Hippocampus P75NTR panel and the Fig 1D Hippocampus ERK2 panel.
○ The Fig 1E Prefrontal cortex N-Shc panel and the Fig 1F Prefrontal cortex NR1 panel.
When levels are adjusted to visualize background, there appear to be vertical irregularities suggestive of splice lines in:
○ The Fig 5B Hippocampus pS473-Act1 panel, between lanes 2 and 3.
○ The Fig 6A Hippocampus NR1 panel, between lanes 2 and 3.
When levels are adjusted to visualize background, there appear to be horizontal and/or vertical irregularities in the background around bands presented in:
○ The Fig 8B Prefrontal cortex panel, between the two bands in lane 2.
○ The Fig 9A Hippocampus BDNF panel, between the BDNF bands in lanes 1–2, and around the BDNF bands in lanes 4–6.
○ The Fig 10A β-actin panel, around lane 3
○ The Fig 10A Prefrontal cortex Pro-BDNG panel, around the area presented below the 15kDa marker in lanes 2–6.
○ The Fig 11B Prefrontal cortex tPA panel, around the bands presented in lanes 5–6.
Regarding point 1, the corresponding author confirmed the duplications and explained that results in the indicated pairs of figure panels (Figs. 2A and 2C, Figs 9A and 11A, Figs 10A and 11B, and Figs 5A and 6A) originated from the same blots, which were re-probed with different antibodies.
The corresponding author disagreed with point 2 and stated that the results presented in these panels were obtained from separate blots.
Regarding points 3 and 4, the corresponding author indicated that the Fig 5B Hippocampus pS473-Act1 panel was spliced during figure preparation. The corresponding author disagreed with the concerns about irregularities in Figs 6A, 9A and 10A suggesting that the observations are likely the result of image artefacts or experimental artefacts such as gel or reagent remnants or protein degradation products.
The corresponding author provided image data to support their western blot results in this [1] and other PLOS ONE articles [2–5]. Per PLOS’ assessment of the data files, the pixel patterns in background areas of blot images provided for multiple panels in [1–5] appear more similar than would be expected for data obtained in independent experiments. The corresponding author stated that the repetitive features in the background noise of the underlying data are likely the result of scanner artifacts.
With the exception of point 1, the data and comments provided to PLOS did not resolve the concerns about the integrity and reliability of the reported data. Therefore, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.
HYW did not agree with the retraction and stands by the article’s findings. AS, KPB, and EF either did not respond directly or could not be reached.

27541862,"+Concerns/Issues About Results
+Concerns/Issues About Image
+Concerns/Issues About Data","After publication of this article [1], concerns were raised about several of the figures as well as inconsistencies between the Materials and Methods and the Results. Specifically, for the figures:
The Anti-BIP 21DAP WT and o10 bands in Fig 4G appear similar to the anti-tubulin panel in S2 Fig F. The corresponding author stated that the western blots in S2 Fig F were assembled in error and provided an updated S2 Fig F where both western blot panels have been replaced with replicate experiments from the time of the original experiments.
The right three lanes in the anti-o10-C panel in Fig 5A appear similar to the right three lanes in an anti-o10 panel in [2] when reflected vertically with altered exposure and contrast. The corresponding author acknowledged the images are likely the same and stated that they do not know which image is correct.
Fig 5B results do not appear to be consistent with the o10 localisation diagrams in Fig 6B which appear to represent ten pictures of PBs for the same assay. The corresponding author stated that Fig 6B is a diagram that summarises the general distribution patterns of o10 and zeins, but the dots do not strictly correspond to data from any given electron microscope image.
In S4 Fig B, lanes 2 and 3 in the anti-o10 panel appear similar to an anti-tubulin panel in Fig 3 16B of [2] when rotated 180°. The corresponding author stated the images are likely the same but that S4 Fig B in [1] is correct.
The corresponding author stated that the original data underlying the results in Figs 2B, 2D-E, 4E-H, 5A-B, 5D, 6A-B, 7A-B, S1 D-F, S2 A, S2 C, S2 E-F and S4 A-B are no longer available.
Several reporting errors were also identified in the Methods and Results.
Due to unresolved figure concerns, the extent of reporting errors, and the unavailability of a substantial amount of the underlying data for this study, the PLOS Genetics Editors retract this article [1].
RS did not agree with retraction. DY, WQ, XL, QY, SY, HL, GaW and GuW did not respond or could not be reached.

+Concerns/Issues about Third Party Involvement
+Concerns/Issues About Image
+Concerns/Issues About Data","After publication of this article [1], concerns were raised about the data reported in Figs 2A and 3B. Several areas within these figures include cell staining patterns that appear to be repeated within and across figure panels, and in some areas the background pixelation appears highly similar across panels. Furthermore, some of the areas are highly similar to staining patterns reported by another group, in Fig 1 of [2]. A member of PLOS ONE’s Editorial Board confirmed that the invasion assay results reported in these figures are critical in supporting the conclusions of the PLOS ONE article.
In discussing these concerns with the authors and a representative at the Gdański Uniwersytet Medyczny, the authors stated that Figs 2 and 3, as well as some Western blots and accompanying densitometry data, were generated by a third-party company whose involvement in this research was not declared in the published article. The company confirmed that they had provided invasion assay and Western blot data for this article, including data presented in Figs 2A and 3B. The company provided images in support of some results in question, but the concerns about image similarities were not fully resolved based on our examination of these data, and some of the original data have not been provided.
The authors provided replication data supporting the results in question but were not able to clarify the concerns raised about the published figures.
In light of the concerns about the integrity of data reported in Figs 2 and 3, and the absence of raw data supporting the published results, the PLOS ONE editors retract this article.
AK and AD did not agree with retraction.

Following the publication of this article, an interested reader drew to our attention that the flow of the text, and the wording of numerous passages of text within the article, bore striking and unexpected similarities to the wording employed in a PhD thesis by Salam Khan at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm in 2015 entitled “Targeting Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia cells using Anti-ROR1 Monoclonal Antibodies and Small Molecule Inhibitors”.
After having conducted an internal investigation, the Editor of Oncology Letters has determined beyond all reasonable doubt that the review submitted to the Journal shared an unacceptable level of identity with the PhD thesis by Salam Khan. The authors were contacted about these apparent similarities between their review and the thesis, and they agree to this retraction.

The Editor has retracted this article. After publication concerns were raised about some of the images shown in Figure 6. These concerns are that for both kidney and liver there appears to be overlap between the NC and MM panels. The authors have not provided the raw data. The Editor therefore no longer has confidence in the results and conclusions presented. The authors have not responded to correspondence from the Editor about this retraction.

After a series of Committee meetings, preliminary investigative reports, and multiple correspondence emails between the Committee and corresponding authors, the Committee made the following conclusions:
1. Four pairs of panels (2c, 9b), (3a, 8c), (3b, 8b) and (3d, 4c) in Fig. 7A, in https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.10427, and two pairs of panels (1a,1c) (2c,3e) in Fig. 6A in https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.2804 appear to be duplicated use of images from the same mice. The Committee finds that these results are falsified and may be misleading.
2. The corresponding authors of these papers, Drs. Chi-Ming Liang and Shu-Mei Liang, and the first author Ming-Yi Ho, all agreed that Dr. Ho is responsible for the execution of the experiments and providing the data.

Following an inquiry at the University of Liverpool, the Editorial Board was recently informed that the mass spectrometry data provided by Daniel J. Antoine is unreliable and likely to be fraudulent. Specifically, data relating to HMGB1 isoforms presented in Figures 1B, 2, 4A, and 5A and Supplemental Figure 3 are not reliable. Due to this finding, the JCI is retracting this article. No issues have been raised with regard to any of the other data in the paper. The corresponding author has stated that data presented in Figure 1A and data related to total HMGB1 blood levels measured by ELISA, which include that in Figure 1B, Figure 2, and Figure 4A as well as data reported in Figure 3 and Figure 4B, are reliable. The corresponding author has also stated that all supplemental figures, except those depicting HMGB1 isoforms, are reliable.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding western blot similarities in Figs. 5B (α-tubulin, between lanes 1–3 and 5–7) and 6C (α-tubulin, between lanes 1–3 and 4–6). Additional checks by the Publisher have found a number of unexpected breaks in the western blot backgrounds in Figs. 3C–F and 5B.
The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the presented data.

The Editors have retracted this Article. Concerns were raised regarding a number of figures, specifically:
Figure 2: the background of some of the blots appear to be unexpectedly clean.
Figure 9A: the Core panels for TUDCA and PERK inhibitor appear to partially overlap.
The authors have stated they were no longer able to locate the original data. The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the reliability of the data reported in the article.

An investigation by the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, where the research was conducted, has concluded that several panels depicted in Figure 5A present false or fabricated data, namely:
the PLA images in columns 1 and 4 of the “- Cisplatin” condition are blank black panels without any data signal
the DAPI image for the “MSH + HBD3 + Cisplatin” condition is a duplicate of the DAPI image for the “MSH + Cisplatin” condition
In addition, the authors were not able to locate all the original data files. The results and conclusions in this article are therefore unreliable.

29029451,"+Notice - Limited or No Information
+Date of Retraction/Other Unknown","This article has been retracted: The National University Corporation Osaka University and National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Hospital in Osaka, Japan, investigated the work of the researcher Takashi Nojiri. Several of his articles in other journals have been retracted/corrected. One article of Takashi Nojiri was published in Oncotarget. https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.18032. Based on the investigation results, which concluded there were several instances of intentional data falsification, Oncotarget has decided to retract this article. The NCVC committee notes, “We believe this paper should be withdrawn, and we have communicated our stance to the lead and corresponding authors.”
Specific concerns of the committee are noted below:
1. Issues (data forgery, falsification) related to Supplementary Figure 4B and Figure 7C: Data from another group were partially used to create secondary data, and discrepancies were discovered between the original data and the data included in the initially submitted version of the manuscript. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the act of acquiring partial data from a treatment group and using it as data representing another group was done unintentionally; therefore, in this case, data falsification was recognized as the result of a deliberate act.
2. Issues (data forgery, falsification) related to Supplementary Figures 9B and 13B: This section revealed a discrepancy between the original data and those used in the initially submitted version of the manuscript. Additionally, all four items, which were believed to exhibit statistically significant differences, actually exhibited no significant difference at allowing to the discrepancies. This inconsistency could not possibly have been caused by a simple misstatement; therefore, the falsification was judged as intentional.
3. Issues (data forgery, falsification) related to Supplementary Figure 5 and Figure 2F: The numbers of mice mentioned in the initially submitted version of the manuscript exhibited inconsistencies as a result of multiple instances of image duplication. Given the number of images duplicated at once, even between different experimental groups, this was considered to be the result of an intentional act.
4. Issues (data forgery, falsification) related to Supplementary Figure 10 and Figure 3E: This section revealed many instances of image duplication, causing inconsistencies between the original data and the numbers of mice mentioned in the initially submitted version of the manuscript. Moreover, this is not considered to be negligence. Given the number of overlapping images at a time, and also among different experimental groups, this was considered to be intentional.
5. Issues (data forgery, falsification) related to Supplementary Figure 15 and Figure 4E: The numbers of mice mentioned in the initially submitted version of the manuscript exhibited inconsistencies due to the duplication of multiple images. Given that so many instances of image duplication occurred simultaneously, these could not have been unintentional; therefore, data falsification was recognized as the result of a deliberate act.

Figure 1A, panel TNS-PEM (x50,000) appears to have been duplicated with regions of panel TNS-PEM-IGF1-100 (x50,000).
Figure 5A, panel TNS-PEM (14 d), TNS-PEM-IGFI-50 (14 d) and TNS-PEM-IGFI-100 (14 d) all appear to have been duplicated with regions of each other.
Figure 5B, panel TNS (21 d), TNS-PEM (21 d), TNS-PEM-IGFI-50 (21 d) and TNS-PEM-IGF1-100 (21 d) all appear to have been duplicated with regions of each other.
The authors responded to our queries but were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged duplication and could not provide satisfactory original data that would validate the findings of their study. The Editor advised for the article to be retracted.
Our decision-making was informed by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retraction.
The retracted article will remain online to maintain the scholarly record, but it will be digitally watermarked on each page as “Retracted”.",,"['Data', 'Images', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Duplication of Data', 'Duplication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Original Data Not Provided', 'Unreliable Data', 'Unreliable Image', 'Unreliable Results']","['Data', 'Images', 'Results']","['Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Duplication of Data', 'Duplication of Image', 'Original Data Not Provided', 'Unreliable Data', 'Unreliable Image', 'Unreliable Results']","['Data', 'Images', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Text']","['Concern/Issues about Article', 'Concerns/Issues About Data', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Duplication of Article', 'Duplication of Data', 'Duplication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image']","['Authorship', 'Data', 'Images', 'Methods', 'Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process', 'Results', 'Text']","['Cites Retracted Work', 'Concerns/Issues About Image', 'Concerns/Issues About Results', 'Contamination of Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Contamination of Materials', 'Copyright Claims', 'Duplicate Publication through Error by Journal/ Publisher', 'Duplication of Article', 'Duplication of Data', 'Duplication of Image', 'Duplication of Text', 'Error in Analyses', 'Error in Cell Lines/Tissues', 'Error in Data', 'Error in Image', 'Error in Materials', 'Error in Materials (General)', 'Error in Results and/or Conclusion', 'False Affiliation', 'Falsification/ Fabrication of Data', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Image', 'Falsification/Fabrication of Results', 'Hoax Paper', 'Investigation by Journal/Publisher', 'Investigation by ORI', 'Miscommunication by Journal/Publisher', 'Original Data Not Provided', 'Plagiarism of Article', 'Plagiarism of Data', 'Plagiarism of Image', 'Plagiarism of Text', 'Results Not Reproducible', 'Unreliable Image', 'Updated to Correction', 'Updated to Retraction', 'Withdrawn to Publish in Different Journal']",[],[],[],[]

+Concerns/Issues About Image
+Concerns/Issues About Authorship/Affiliation","The PLOS ONE Editors retract this article [1] because it was identified as one of a series of submissions for which we have concerns about peer review, authorship, and similarities across articles. Image similarities were noted between the GAPDH panel of Fig 4E in [1] and the GAPDH panel of Fig 4J in [2]. These concerns call into question the validity and provenance of the reported results. We regret that the issues were not addressed prior to the article’s publication.

The Editor and Publisher of OncoTargets and Therapy wish to retract the published paper. Concerns were raised regarding the alleged manipulation and duplication of tumor images shown in Figure 6B. Specifically:
Figure 6B, top row images for sh-NC, appear to be duplicated with images of the same tumors in Figure 2D from Liu et al, 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2019.108862) and Figure 6B from Li et al, 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2018.03.122).
Similarly, Figure 6B, bottom row images for sh-LINC00152, also appear to be duplicated with images of the same tumors in Figure 2D from Liu et al, 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2019.108862) and Figure 6B from Li et al, 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2018.03.122).
The authors responded to our queries but could not provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged duplication or provide adequate raw data for their study. The findings of the study were deemed invalid and the Editor requested for the article to be retracted.
Our decision-making was informed by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retraction.

The Editors have retracted this Article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding high similarity among the following:
multiple lanes within each of the Coomassie blue staining images in Figs. 3h, 6c, S1a and S2a;
DNP blot images in Figs. 3h (H2O2 + pNaKtide group), S1a (both lanes in Y group and left lane in O + WD + P group) and S2a (OB and O groups);
pSRC blot images in Figs. S2b (OB group) and 3i (pNaKtide, H2O2 and H2O2 + pNaKtide groups).
Further investigation has found that there are unexplained similarities between images representing different groups in:
Figs. 3a (Control and H2O2 + pNaKtide) and S4a (Control and UV + pNaKtide);

The Editors have retracted this Article.
After publication of this Article it was brought to the Editors’ attention that some of the images appear to overlap with those in other published articles partially from the same author group, where the data is partially attributed to different samples. Specifically:
In Fig 2C the “SiHa-23” group appears to partially overlap with Fig 2C “A19” group in1;
In Fig 4D the “Fibulin-3 cDNA, HeLa-25” group appears to be rotated and partially overlaps with Fig 3C “U-2OS” group in2;
In Fig 8B the “N-cadherin” group (left panel, right side of image) appears to partially overlap with Fig 8C “Vimentin” group (left panel, left side of image).
The Editors reached out to the Authors to request raw data. The Authors provided the data which did not address the concerns. The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the results presented in this Article.
Juan Li, Chen Qi, Xia Liu, Changzhong Li, and Jie Chen did not respond to the correspondence about this retraction. Min Shi did not state explicitly whether they agree to or disagree with this retraction.

This article has been retracted at the request of the editors.
Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids is retracting this article. After investigating concerns of image duplication raised by a reader, evidence for image duplication in identical or altered fashion in Figures 2C and 2D was identified. This reuse (and in part, misrepresentation) of data without appropriate attribution represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. No authors responded to the notification of retraction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. An investigation by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research at Washington University in St. Louis concluded that:
Figure panels 2a-f, labeled as the brain cancer cell line GBM U118, appeared to be falsified and/or fabricated, and were also used in multiple NIH grant applications as the brain cancer cell line GM139 or as the IMR90 cell line.
Figure 3 appeared to be produced by cutting out and reusing three lanes from a heatmap that was previously used in a 2014 NIH grant application. The heatmap lanes in the grant application were labelled as iOPCs, WT (dermal fibroblasts) and OPC (Ctrl), while the lanes in Figure 3 in this publication were labeled as iN, GBM cells and Ctrl neuron.
Figure 4c, labeled as iN cells in the 2018 this publication, appeared to be falsified and/or fabricated, and was also published in [1] labeled as iRLs from the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468.
Figure panel 4d, labeled as GBM U18 cells, appeared to be produced by reusing, manipulating, and relabeling photographs from Figure 1c labeled as IMR90 cells in [2].
An additional concern identified as part of the investigation is extensive overlap between this publication and [1].
In addition, the authors have been unable to provide any records of ethics approval for the animal study to the Editor. Limeng He and Zhen Zhang have stated that they were not aware of their inclusion in the author list of this study.
Dennis Hallahan, Zhen Zhang, Liming He and Ling-gang Wu agree to this retraction. Jie Yuan, Fan Zhang, Meng You and Qin Yang have not responded to any correspondence from the editor or publisher about this retraction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this original article following an investigation by Universiteit Leiden providing evidence of manipulated data. The institutional investigation concluded that 6 participants (test subjects) were omitted from the article without adequate or transparent explanation in the article why participants were excluded from the analysis. The main findings of the paper (e.g., correlation between the measure of heart rate variability and switch costs) may not be supported when including the six missing participants.
Given the concerns reported with this article, the Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the presented results and conclusions.
Bryant J. Jongkees, Matthijs de Wit, Melle J. W. van der Molen and Laura Steenbergen agree to this retraction. Lorenza S. Colzato does not agree to this retraction.

The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article because of concerns that a number of panels in Figs. 2d, 4d and 4e are duplicated from previously published articles. Specifically:
The eight panels in Fig. 2d appear to be the same as panels in Fig. 2B of [1].
Eleven of the panels in Fig. 4d appear to be the same as panels in Fig. 2C of [1].
Five of the panels in Fig. 4e appear to overlap with panels in Fig. 3A of [2].
The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the validity of the data reported. None of the authors has responded to correspondence from the Publisher about this retraction.

Following an investigation conducted by the Hindawi Research Integrity team [2], significant concerns were identified with the peer reviewers assigned to this article; the investigation has concluded that the peer review process was compromised. We therefore can no longer trust the peer review process and the article is being retracted with the agreement of the Chief Editor.

Retraction of ‘Organometallic Ag nanostructures prepared using Hypericum perforatum extract are highly effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria’ by Qaisar Maqbool et al., RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 30562–30572.
We, the named authors, wholly retract this RSC Advances article.
The authors have repeated the FTIR and TGA analyses of the nanoparticles synthesised using H. perforatum, and also obtained the original data files from the facility that carried out the initial analyses. The authors have compared the new results and the original data files with the data in the published article. They found that the graphs presented in Fig. 7a and b in the article did not correspond to neither the original data nor the new analysis. They also found that the same TGA graph (Fig. 7b) was used in previous articles by the first author but representing a different material.1,2
The Institute of Plant Genetics of the Polish Academy of Sciences have confirmed to the Royal Society of Chemistry that graphs presented in Fig. 7 of this RSC Advances article were manipulated.
The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to readers.

Figure 4E, Hippocampus, Saline appears to have been duplicated with the same image from Figure 4E, Hippocampus, Ethanol.
Figure 6B, TNF-α, Hippocampus, P8, appears to have been duplicated with the same image from Figure 10D, TNF-α, Hippocampus, Ethanol + Cb from Ullah et al, 2022 (https://doi.org/10.2147/JIR.S351913).
Figure 6C, p-NF-κB, Hippocampus, P8, appears to have been duplicated with the same image from Figure 10F, COX-2, Hippocampus, Ethanol + DNP from Ullah et al, 2022 (https://doi.org/10.2147/JIR.S351913).
Figure 6C, p-NF-κB, Hippocampus, P8, appears to have been duplicated with the same image from Figure 6C, p-NF-κB, Hippocampus, P9.
The authors responded to our queries but were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the duplicated images. The Editor requested for the article to be retracted and the authors were notified of this.
