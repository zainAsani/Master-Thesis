Only for two suppressors — p21 encoded by beet western yellow virus73 and p19 encoded by the tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) group63,74 — is there a clear indication of how they act. In both cases, the virus suppressor protein binds to and, presumably, inactivates siRNAs so that they do not target the corresponding viral RNAs. For p19, the high resolution crystal structures for two different TBSV-group proteins, combined with molecular and biochemical data, indicate precisely how silencing is blocked.

Because these cells are very close to hepatocytes, some RS (for example, H2O2) are able to diffuse into hepatocytes and induce intracellular signaling [68]. In this context, these RS would amplify intracellular effects caused by the viral proteins themselves, although they could also activate intracellular antioxidant defences that could prevent or allow increases in oxidative stress [69].Generally, in parallel to the RS increase in HCV infection, there is a decrease in antioxidant defence, such as glutathione content, which contributes to the oxidation of important cellular components. These changes can lead to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [69–72].

E. bonariensis and E. sumatrensis are two of the most problematic, noxious, invasive and widespread weeds in different cropping systems around the world, especially in no-till farming systems, due to the persistence of the seeds in the soil seedbank and the lack of soil disturbance, which allows rosette plantlets to grow without being removed [27,28,29]. They are very competitive for resources, causing important yield losses in many crops, as soybean, cotton, corn, cereals, legumes, forages, fruit, and vegetable crops [27,28]. In the last two decades several studies have been published on their biology and ecology [22,25,28,32], genetic variation [33], allelopathic effects [34], or resistance to pesticides [35,36,37,38]. Moreover, their seed germination ecology was analysed [22,29,39,40] but to our knowledge tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity in different growth stages were not previously investigated. The present study was conducted to evaluate the tolerance of E. bonariensis and E. sumatrensis to salt stress and water deficit during seed germination and vegetative growth and to examine the main mechanism of their stress responses. The number of seeds reported in E. bonariensis was up to 375,500 seeds per plant [56], and the seeds of both species are light and attached to a pappus with anemochore dispersal over large distances [57]. Other traits of these species, such as low seed dormancy, a high emergence rate, and the evolution of increasing resistance to glyphosate, make them particularly serious invasive weed [22,29,40]. Germination in E. sumatrensis was also more affected in our experimental conditions by the highest salt solution applied, as only 16% of seeds germinated at 150 mM NaCl. Mahajan et al. [40] reported that seeds of this species did not germinate at 180 mM NaCl, although in a study comparing germination of seeds originating from different climatic conditions and different soil types, notable differences were found between populations [29]. Germination percentages such as those found in the presence of NaCl, although low considering the high number of seeds produced, can lead to new populations established under stress conditions, as has been reported in other species. Optimal germination was found in the absence of stress: a higher germination percentage with a mean of 96% was found in the control treatment in E. bonariensis, while in E. sumatrensis only 82%, which are similar to those reported for the two species under optimal conditions [29,39]. However, slightly higher germination in the former species cannot be associated with higher invasiveness, as germination percentage is not considered a consistent predictor of invasiveness, more relevant is the speed of germination [42].","+Fake Peer Review

Indirect transmission routes of Helicobacter spp. through animals such as dogs, cats, birds, monkeys, etc. have been suggested, because of the high incidence of Helicobacter spp. in the gut of these animals. Domesticated animals, especially pets, are considered a potential risk factor for the transmission of infection to human hosts as a result of their close interactions [9,12]. For example, studies in Iran, Poland, and Brazil showed that 87.5%, 93.9%, and 94.7% of dogs were infected with Helicobacter spp., respectively [6,13].","+Plagiarism of Text

18197254,2186382,Antibiotics Threaten Wildlife: Circulating Quinolone Residues and Disease in Avian Scavengers,21152405,2994777,Livestock Drugs and Disease: The Fatal Combination behind Breeding Failure in Endangered Bearded Vultures,"These threats may be especially detrimental to wildlife as they increasingly concur and interact as a consequence of the elimination of livestock residues containing veterinary pharmaceuticals and resistant pathogens due to growing intensive livestock operations worldwide [6], [8], [9]. In particular, the ingestion of antimicrobials, primarily fluoroquinolones, has been recently related to immunodepression-mediated acquisition of opportunistic pathogens and disease, as well as to organ damage in nestling vultures [6], [10], [11]. Fluoroquinolone residues have also been found in avian scavenger eggs and are associated with severe alterations in the development of embryo cartilage and bones that could preclude embryo movement and subsequently normal development, pre-hatch position and successful hatching [12]. Therefore, we specifically focused on determining whether breeding failure in bearded vultures is related to the ingestion of veterinary drugs from stabled livestock carrion, as documented in other avian scavenger species [12]. We also assessed the potential effects of veterinary drugs on embryo damage and immunodepression increasing the probability of acquisition and proliferation of pathogens causing fatal disease [6], [10]–[12], [21]. Because veterinary drugs should be exclusively acquired from the ingestion of carrion from livestock medicated to combat disease, we predict that their presence should be associated with that of pathogens acquired from the same livestock, especially poultry pathogens more likely transmitted between avian species [22]. The age of embryos and nestlings were estimated according to size and development. Samples of liver, kidney, spleen, large and small intestines, lungs, brain, lymphoid organs (thymus, bursa of Fabricius, Peyer's patches) and knee joints were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, sectioned at 4 µm and stained for histopathological analysis [10], [12]. Liver (dead nestlings and failed embryos) and yolk (failed embryos) were used for the determination of the presence of veterinary drugs, including fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin), other antimicrobials (amoxicillin and oxytetracycline), non-steroideal anti-inflamatories (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac, flunixin meglumine, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, meloxicam, sodium salicylate, acetaminophen, and antiparasitics (metronidazole, diclazuril, fenbendazole, ivermectin) as described previously [12]. Liver (dead nestlings and failed embryos) and yolk (failed embryos) were used for the determination of the presence of veterinary drugs, including fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin), other antimicrobials (amoxicillin and oxytetracycline), non-steroideal anti-inflamatories (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac, flunixin meglumine, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, meloxicam, sodium salicylate, acetaminophen, and antiparasitics (metronidazole, diclazuril, fenbendazole, ivermectin) as described previously [12]. The limits of quantification, percentage recoveries, and inter- and intra-assay reproducibility were adequate [10], [12].Other contaminants potentially affecting eggs and embryos were determined in liver, including heavy metals (Cd, Zn, Pb and Hg), following Blanco et al. [23], dithiocarbamate thiram, disulfuram, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, organochlorines and brominated flame retardants, following Lemus et al. [12] and carbamate and organophosphate pesticides (carbofuran, aldicarb and fenthion) following Elliot et al. [24]. Potential contamination was assessed by comparison with levels from apparently normal wild birds of other species [26] in the absence of basal levels for bearded vultures. Determination of bacterial and fungal pathogens were conducted by sampling oropharynx, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and intestine with sterile swabs and cultured using standard microbiology protocols [10], [12], [27], [28]. Salmonella serotypes and phage types were determined in the Spanish Reference Laboratory (Laboratorio Central Veterinario, Algete, Madrid). They also showed multiple internal organ damage and pathogens potentially acquired from medicated livestock carrion, especially viruses often infecting poultry. Recorded drug concentrations were among the highest reported in avian scavengers [6], [10]–[12], [21]. NSAIDs and antiparasitics were found in lower prevalence than fluoroquinolones, but at higher concentrations than those found in other avian scavengers, especially for flunixin meglumine and sodium salicylate [6], [12], [21]. Other pollutants were found in low prevalence and concentrations posing low risk to embryo and nestling health. Fluoroquinolones may cause generalized direct developmental damage precluding embryo hatching, physiological alterations due to their impact on liver and kidney and immunodepression reducing resistance to opportunistic pathogens [6], [10]–[12], [21]. These pathogens may be acquired at the same time that drugs used to treat diseased livestock are ingested, as indicated by their high prevalence in embryos and nestlings. In this sense, it is remarkable that bearded vultures primarily feed upon livestock bones, which are one of the major target tissues of fluoroquinolones in medicated animals [56], therefore, rendering this species especially sensitive to the consequences of an increase in the consumption of stabled intensively medicated livestock. The presence of veterinary drugs in eggs implies their previous presence at least in breeding females [12], but also probably in breeding males and non-breeders frequently using artificial feeding sites and livestock carcass dumps [17], where veterinary drugs may be ingested from medicated livestock carcasses [10], [21]. Therefore, further research is required to determine the impact of veterinary drugs and livestock disease on fitness of full-grown individuals, including the potentially subtle, sublethal or indirect effects of these factors on population dynamics.","+Unreliable Data

The stressed heart demands more cardiac output which leads to compensative hypertrophic responses such as neurohormonal activation and increased growth factors and cytokines, resulting in enlarged cardiomyocytes and increased sarcomere assembly. ER stress may play a critical role in regulating protein synthesis in cardiac myocytes, and thereby produce cell enlargement and cardiac hypertrophy. Chronic alcohol consumption by FVB (Friend virus-B type) albino mice at 4% of diet for 12 weeks resulted in increased heart weight and heart-to-body weight ratio [56]. In the myocardium of the FVB mice chronically fed alcohol, GRP78, CHOP, and IRE1a protein expression levels were increased, indicative of the UPR. Class I alcohol dehydrogenase efficiently oxidizes alcohol resulting in increased production of acetaldehyde. Overexpressing alcohol dehydrogenase in the FVB mice during chronic ethanol treatment resulted in a greater UPR upregulation [56]. The finding indicates that acetaldehyde from alcohol metabolism may induce ER stress. Furthermore, overexpressing of the antioxidant protein metallothionein in FVB mice significantly reduced peak shortening and maximal shortening velocity of cardiac myocytes by LPS, which is often elevated in alcoholics [13–15, 39, 40]. In parallel, the transgenic FVB mice displayed decreased protein levels of GRP78, CHOP, PERK, and IRE1 whereas the wild type FVB displayed a significant increase in the protein levels of PERK, phospho-JNK, and phospho-p38 in the myocardium in response to LPS [56, 57]. Alcohol-derived acetaldehyde is highly reactive [58–62]. It is known that atherosclerosis develops as a result of protein unfolding and modification of protein and/or macromolecular complex function at the cellular level [63]. In supporting this, evidence for ER stress response was found in transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of ADH that increased acetaldehyde exposure [56, 57]. The ADH transgene increased induction of IRE1, eIF-2α, GRP78, and CHOP and exacerbated chronic alcohol ingestion-induced myocardial dysfunction and hypertrophy.","+Investigation by Company/Institution

This is despite the popularity of the sport and recent evidence showing that elite senior and semi-elite footballers experience LBP more severely and frequently than non-athletic controls, with this trend being more evident in elite players [11]. Thus, the primary objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence, intensity, quality and frequency of LBP in junior Australian Rules footballers. Although there was no difference between the elite junior and non-elite junior players in their belief of whether LBP impacted their performance, both groups had over 25% report that LBP affected their performance some of the time or greater. Of interest, the elite juniors have a prevalence and overall LBP rating the same as semi-elite senior Australian football code participants, using the same research methodology [11]. Strengths of our study include the use of validated questionnaires to quantify the intensity (QVAS) and quality of LBP (MPQ-SF). Functional disability associated with LBP was not determined. Limitations exist in the study conducted. Firstly, the convenience sample taken for the non-football playing school children and non-elite junior players is not a random population sample and may not be representative. However, random sampling not producing a 100% response rate has been discussed as potentially leading to overestimates of LBP in similar research [11,16].

For example, quantifying home range overlap zones may be a useful proxy for inferring potential species interactions and encounter rates (Robert et al., 2012; Sanchez & Hudgens, 2015), (but see Vander Wal et al., 2014), which is critical for expanding our understanding of infectious disease ecology (Gangoso et al., 2009; Hoover et al., 2020), mating behaviors, territorial behavior (van Overveld, Gangoso, et al., 2020), breeding behavior (Anderson, 2004; Leepile et al., 2020; Xirouchakkis & Mylonas, 2007), sociality, and information sharing as well as the location and pulling effect of high‐quality habitats and resources (Cortés‐Avizanda et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2008; Kane et al., 2015; Murn & Anderson, 2008). High‐quality habitats here refer to beneficial communal roosting and breeding colony zones where social information can be shared, as well as sites where food is abundant and predictable (Arkumarev et al., 2014; Cecere et al., 2018; Cortés‐Avizanda et al., 2014; Kane et al., 2015). Based on this observation, we can infer the existence of social ties among the three vultures (Vultures 4, 5, and 6) which could possibly explain the consistent spatial attraction for their home ranges. Robert et al. (2012) found a strong correlation between home range overlap and species encounter rates which could have implications for the spread of diseases which have been cited as one of the factors contributing to vulture declines (Gangoso et al., 2009). The strong spatial overlaps could suggest frequent and intensive contacts among the vultures, which could suggest shared key breeding, roosting, and feeding zones. Such zones may require preferential conservation attention. Our study provides some of the first and vital empirical evidence on utilization distributions and intra‐specific home range overlaps patterns for white‐backed vulture species. In that context, home range overlap estimates reported here are important for spatial conservation planning, especially with regards to critically endangered African vultures. The findings provide new insights which can inform our understanding of space use sharing among vulture populations and how such spatial arrangements can drive other ecological and social processes such as social evolution, information sharing, and the disease ecology (Gangoso et al., 2009; Hoover et al., 2020; Leepile et al., 2020; van Overveld, Blanco, et al., 2020). However, because the sample size of our study is small, caution should be taken when interpreting our findings.","+Unreliable Data

In the endogenous state, where no or insufficient serotonin or dopamine precursors are ingested, competitive inhibition does not exist. Aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) metabolizes L-dopa to dopamine, 5-HTP to serotonin, histidine to histamine, and phenylalanine to phenylethylamine. Competitive inhibition may exist between the four precursors for metabolism by AADC. Administering L-dopa without balanced serotonin precursor concentrations may decrease AADC serotonin synthesis. This causes a L-dopa-induced serotonin precursor RND, Figure 2. Organic Cation Transporters (OCT) transport the centrally acting monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their precursors bidirectionally across cell membranes. Increasing only L-dopa and dopamine concentrations induces competitive inhibition at the transporter, an event that may exclude serotonin precursor transport leading to synthesis inhibition. Subsequent serotonin depletion represents a serotonin precursor RND. The monoamine oxidase-A catalyzes centrally acting monoamine metabolism. Increasing dopamine concentrations with L-dopa enhances monoamine oxidase-A activity which may deplete serotonin, inducing a serotonin precursor RND.The PD clinical course is typically described as irreversible PN. As discussed in the following section, this RND has RPN symptoms that are identical to irreversible PN. It is postulated that the primary PD etiology is lipophilic neurotoxin-induced post-synaptic dopamine neuron damage.The body’s most powerful and abundant protection against lipophilic neurotoxins is glutathione.","+Updated to Retraction

There is no consistent direct relationship between serotonin and dopamine amino acid precursor daily dosing levels and the amount of serotonin and dopamine that appears in the urine on monoamine assays.3–5 The peer-reviewed literature notes that there is no relationship between administration of the serotonin precursor, 5-HTP, in varied doses and subsequent urinary serotonin levels.4 The literature also notes that there is a correlation between administration of L-tyrosine and urinary dopamine levels, but this is an inverse relationship,4 and not the direct relationship predicted by the UNT model.6,7 The UNT model advocates that there is a dominant direct correlation between amino acid doses and urinary serotonin and urinary dopamine found on assay. If a direct correlation is found between amino acid dosing and urinary assay response, it is referred to as a Phase III response. An inverse correlation is referred to as a Phase I response.3–5 Unexpected results with matched-pairs t-test analysis revealed no significant difference when comparing baseline monoamine assays with assays performed while taking supplemental amino acid precursors in the same subject. Peer-reviewed scientific publications discussing urinary serotonin and urinary dopamine phase analysis according to the OCT model were first published in 20093,4 and 2010.5 These publications outlined the mechanics of the three-phase model in connection with urinary serotonin and urinary dopamine under a novel renal transporter model. The literature notes that urinary serotonin and urinary dopamine are monoamines that are newly synthesized from serotonin and dopamine amino acid precursors by the kidneys in the proximal convoluted renal tubule cells.3,5 These newly synthesized serotonin and dopamine molecules are then either transported out of the proximal convoluted renal tubule cells across the basolateral membrane and then into the peripheral system via the renal vein or across the apical membrane and then into the urine.3–5,14,15 It is noted that there are many other renal interactions that exist between synthesis of serotonin and dopamine transported across the basolateral membrane and the apical membrane prior to arriving at the final destination of the renal vein or urine, respectively. These interactions appear small in comparison with the effects of the basolateral monoamine transporter and the apical monoamine transporter under the three-phase model.5 There is also no correlation between urinary serotonin and dopamine levels and the serotonin or dopamine levels within the central and peripheral nervous systems.3–5 The renal interaction of urinary serotonin, urinary dopamine, and their amino acid precursors is counterintuitive. It is expected that when serotonin and/or dopamine amino acid precursors are administered, levels of the associated urinary serotonin or urinary dopamine will increase or decrease with increases or decreases in the amino acid precursor daily dosing levels, ie, a direct relationship. Outcomes are not intuitive because the process is complex, and there is no simple, dominant, direct relationship between serotonin and dopamine amino acid dosing and monoamine assays. Instead, a complex interaction is found, giving rise to the three-phase model, as we have previously proposed.3–5 Furthermore, there is no significant statistical difference between baseline monoamine levels in the urine and those resulting from administration of monoamine precursors.","+Updated to Retraction

If only 5-HTP or 5-HTP that dominates dopamine at the enzyme is administered, it will block dopamine synthesis at the AAAD enzyme through competitive inhibition, leading to depletion of dopamine and the rest of the catecholamines.Metabolism of serotonin and dopamine is catalyzed by monoamine oxidase (MAO). With increasing doses of 5-HTP, which lead to increased serotonin levels, MAO activity increases. Without a properly balanced increase in dopamine there will be increased metabolism of dopamine leading to depletion.The synthesis, metabolism, and transport of serotonin and dopamine, along with their amino acid precursors, are primarily controlled by the functional status of transport, which is carried out by organic cation transporters (OCT). Competitive inhibition occurs during the balanced and unbalanced state. In the unbalanced state, amino acid precursors of serotonin or dopamine dominate the opposite system in synthesis, metabolism, and transport, leading to depletion of nondominant monoamine neurotransmitters (Figure 2). Numerous studies published since 2009 document the need to administer serotonin amino acid precursors simultaneously in proper balance with dopamine precursors in order to prevent depletion (Figures 1 and 2). Specific examples of a dominant monoamine depleting a nondominant monoamine and/or amino acid precursor are listed here and illustrated in Figure 2. An amino acid precursor no longer functioning can be observed in the management of Parkinson’s disease in which the effects of l-dopa are no longer observed over time due to serotonin depletion.7–15. A study involving properly balanced serotonin and dopamine amino acid precursor dosing values guided by MTO published in 2009 and 2010 documents that administration of properly balanced serotonin and dopamine precursors is not only highly effective for managing depression, but can also be used to differentiate bipolar depression cycling heavily on the depressive pole from unipolar depression (major affective disorder).2,6 Proper balancing of serotonin and dopamine amino acid precursors, which can only be optimized using MTO, is critical. To achieve optimal efficacy, minimal side effects, and prevent depletion of other amino acids and neurotransmitters, 5-HTP must be administered in proper balance with dopamine amino acid precursors along with proper levels of sulfur amino acids.","+Updated to Retraction

One protein, Smlt0378, was shown to act as a cell–cell signal that plays a crucial regulatory role in cell motility and virulence in S. maltophilia (Ferrer-Navarro et al. 2013; McCarthy et al. 2011). All previous studies on the function of Ax21 family proteins were limited to plant or human pathogenic species in the bacterial family Xanthomonadaceae. Furthermore, the three double mutants (Δlsp12, Δlsp13 and Δlsp23), and the triple mutant (Δlsp123) produced WAP-8294A2 at levels similar to that produced by each single mutant, implying that the Lsp proteins do not exert additive effects in regulating WAP-8294A2 biosynthesis. The involvement of Ax21 family proteins in regulating virulence-related traits was previously documented in certain pathogenic species of Xanthomonas and Stenotrophomonas, establishing the initial understanding of the regulatory function of this family of proteins in bacteria (Qian et al. 2013; McCarthy et al. 2011). However, the role of Ax21 family proteins in non-pathogenic bacteria had not been established until this study. Here, we show that Ax21-family proteins (Lsp) in the biological control agent L. enzymogenes play a vital role in regulating the biosynthesis of antimicrobial secondary metabolites. The Lsp proteins do regulate the trait (HSAF and WAP-8294A2) critical to the ecological functioning of L. enzymogenes, but the deletion of lsp genes together and in combination had no detectable effects on the ability of the bacterium to produce lytic enzymes or to engage in twitching motility. The latter finding was particularly surprising considering that Ax21 family proteins have been shown to regulate flagella-driven swimming motility in Xoo and S. maltophilia (McCarthy et al. 2011; Ferrer-Navarro et al. 2013; Park et al. 2014). Our findings do suggest that the regulatory role of Ax21 family proteins in cell motility is variable among different members of the Xanthomonadaceae family. In contrast, only one Ax21-family protein has been reported in Xoo (Bahar et al. 2014), while two Ax21-like proteins (Smlt0387 and Smlt0184) were identified in S. maltophilia (Devos et al. 2015). Among the two Ax21-family proteins found in S. maltophilia, only one (Smlt0387) has been shown to function in the regulation of motility, biofilm formation and virulence (Ferrer-Navarro et al. 2013; McCarthy et al. 2011), while the role of Smlt0184 remains unknown. These studies collectively show that different members of the Xanthomonadaceae family have the potential to express different numbers of Ax21 family proteins","+Misconduct by Author

Its expression inversely correlates with metastasis in human breast cancer patients and overexpression of this miRNA suppresses metastasis in vitro. It has been demonstrated to suppress a number of metastasis-promoting target genes thereby affecting several steps of metastasis formation such as local invasion, extravasation, and metastatic colonization (18, 20, 21).

AKBA inhibited constitutively active STAT3 and STAT3-targeted genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis by activating Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), which is responsible for dephosphorylation of STAT-3 [25]. The anti-cancer efficacy of BAs has also been demonstrated in vivo in colorectal, pancreatic, leukemia and prostate cancers [15, 22, 26–28]. In a HT-29 colon cancer xenograft model, AKBA activated apoptotic proteins, suppressed inflammatory cytokines, and modulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ATM/p53 signaling pathways resulting in inhibition of adenocarcinoma growth, G1-phase cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis [21, 26, 29]. Acetyl-β-BA and AKBA promoted apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation and prostate tumor burden in PC-3 transplanted NMRI/nu-nu mice, PC-3 xenograft and PC-3 xenotransplanted mouse models [28, 32, 33]. Further in vivo studies revealed that 3-α-butyryloxy-β-BA and AKBA induced cancer cell specific apoptosis, inhibited metastasis and suppressed tumor growth of leukemia and pancreatic tumors [22, 27]. Cucurbitacins (Cu) are a group of tetracyclic triterpenes derived from the climbing-stems of members of the pumpkin and gourd families (Fig. 1) [34]. Experimental in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that downregulation of NF-κB activity by natural or synthetic compounds suppresses the development of carcinogen-induced tumors, inhibits the growth of cancer cells, and induces apoptosis by altering gene expression crucial for the control of carcinogenesis and cancer cell survival [195]. In pancreatic cancer cell lines, AKBA inhibited the constitutively active NF-κB and the expression of NF-κB target genes such as COX-2, MMP-9, CXCR4, and VEGF [22]. Deguelin induces apoptosis of cancer cells by blocking the IKK-IκBα-NF-κB pathway [59]. The transcription factor NF-κB, a critical signaling molecule in host innate immunity, is activated in response to the formation of an inflammatory tumor microenvironment during malignant progression and upregulates the expression of tumor promoting cytokines, such as IL-6 or TNF-α, and survival genes, such as Bcl-XL [200]. BA, mangiferin, WA, and UA have anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting NF-κB activation and its downstream targets such as COX-2, MMP-9, CXCR4, and VEGF expression [22].

Details concerning the retraction are described in Lee et al. (2013), Han et al. (2013) and Ronald (2013). Some of the retracted results have been reproduced in other laboratories (Shuguo et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). They further showed that Ax21 secretion in Xoc RS105 depends on RaxA and that supernatants from the Xoc ax21 deletion mutant cannot induce XA21-mediated resistance, while supernatants from the wild type strain can. Subsequent research from our lab, focused on the biological function of Ax21 in Xanthomonas, suggested that Ax21 serves as a cell–cell signaling molecule mediating motility, biofilm formation and virulence (Han et al., 2011). However, this report was also retracted (Ronald, 2013; Han et al., 2013). Here too, several labs have reproduced some of our results in other bacterial species (McCarthy, Dow & Ryan, 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Qian et al., 2013). Western blots were carried out following standard procedures (Sambrook Fritsch & Maniatis, 1989). Ax21 protein was detected using an anti-Ax21 antibody. The generation of this antibody was first described in Han et al. (2011), and is described here again. Ax21 monoclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit against the 17 aa Ax21 synthetic peptide (axY S22). Peptides and antibodies were generated by Pacific Immunology (http://www.pacificimmunology.com/). For Western blots, the Ax21 antibody and a secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody were used at dilutions of 1:3,000 and 1:5,000, respectively. We carried out Western blot analysis to validate the presence of secreted Ax21 in the extracellular milieu. PXO99 cultures were grown similarly to the previously described methods for enriching for Ax21 in the supernatant (Han et al., 2011), and probed with an anti-Ax21 antibody (Fig. 1). As reported previously, Ax21 is detected in the supernatants of PXO99 (Lee et al., 2009). We found that Ax21 is present in Xcc supernatants grown under enriching conditions (Fig. S1). Together, these experiments indicate that Ax21 is not processed by RaxB and does not require the predicted type I secretion components (RaxA, RaxB and RaxC) for secretion as previously suggested (Lee et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2013; Han et al., 2011; Han et al., 2013). These results conflict with publications by two independent research groups. In Gram-negative bacteria, proteins processed by the Sec system can be destined to the inner membrane, periplasmic space, outer membrane, or the extracellular space. We previously showed that Ax21 was found in the supernatant of Xoo cultures, and culturing methods were developed for Ax21 enrichment in the supernatant (Lee et al., 2009; Han et al., 2011). PFAM searches of the Ax21 sequence suggest that it falls into the family of β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMP) (e-value = 9.1e−08) (Altschul et al., 1990; Sonnhammer, Eddy & Durbin, 1997).","+Removed

Harboring three cysteine residues (C23, C45, and C106) that are redox-sensitive, HMGB1 can be modified into three isoforms termed “HMGB1” (all-thiol form), “disulfide HMGB1” (partially oxidized), and oxidized HMGB1 (Figure 1) [34, 35]. The “all-thiol” HMGB1 binds to other chemokines (e.g., CXCL12) and stimulates leukocyte recruitment via the CXCR4 receptor [36]. The “disulfide” HMGB1 can activate immune cells to produce cytokines/chemokines via TLR4 or other receptors such as RAGE [33], TLR2, TLR4 [37–39], TLR9 [23, 33], cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24)/Siglec-10 [40], Mac-1 [41], thrombomodulin [42], or single transmembrane domain proteins (e.g., syndecans) [43]. Once fully oxidized, the HMGB1 is devoid of either chemokine or cytokine activities (Figure 1) [34, 35]. Thus, HMGB1 can function either as a chemokine to stimulate leukocyte migration [41, 44, 45] or as a cytokine to activate macrophages [37, 46, 47] and endothelial cells [48, 49] to produce more cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules.","+Updated to Retraction

Highly virulent velogenic viruses give values approaching 2, and avirulent or lentogenic strains give values at or close to 0. To evaluate neurotropism of parental and mutant APMV-4 in vitro, primary chicken neuronal cells were prepared from 9-day-old chicken embryos for virus infection [27], [36]. After 72 h of infection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton, stained with antiserum against the N protein and polyclonal antibodies against a neuronal marker (anti-neuron specific beta III tubulin antibody, abcam®, Cambridge, MA) followed by anti-Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 antibodies, and then analyzed by confocal microscopy. Virus titers in DF1 cells were determined by limiting dilution and immunostaining as described above. To obtain more sensitive detection of replication, tissue samples from the 2-week-old chickens also were inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs [36]. At 3 dpi, the allantoic fluids were tested for virus growth by HA assay. The various tissue samples harvested from infected 2-week-old chickens and 3-week-old ducks were fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin (10%), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (Histoserv, Inc., Germantown, MD). Sections from mock-infected birds were used as controls. The tissues were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subsequently, immunostained to detect viral N protein [36]. A cDNA clone of the antigenomic RNA of APMV-4 was constructed from six cDNA segments that were synthesized by RT-PCR from virion-derived genomic RNA (Fig. 1). In contrast, the other cleavage site sequences did not confer increased cleavage efficiency and replication in vitro. In contrast, evaluation of the pathogenicity of the wild-type and mutant APMV-4 viruses using the ICPI and MDT assays indicated avirulence of APMV-4 [10], [36] without any increase in pathogenicity by any of the mutations. These findings are incongruent with the well-known NDV paradigm, in which the presence of a furin site is a major determinant of virulence [11], [26]. However, all of the birds exhibited seroconversion, suggesting that viral infection occurred in each case, but at a low level that often was undetectable by assays for infectious virus. Our recent pathogenicity study with the nine APMV serotypes showed inefficient replication of APMV-4 in chickens [36]. The present results confirm the highly restricted nature of replication of APMV-4, and show that this high level of restriction was not alleviated by the introduction of additional basic residues, including a furin motif, into the F protein cleavage site.","+Original Data not Provided

NDRG2 has been widely implicated in carcinogenesis including breast cancer invasion [8], angiogenesis [9] and metastasis [10–12]. Recent studies indicated decreased NDRG2 expression due to promoter DNA-hypermethylation [13,14], underlining a possible tumor suppressive role of NDRG2 in breast carcinogenesis. Differences were considered statistically significant if the two sided p-values were equal or below 5% (≤0.05). Although NDRG2 is thought to be a potential tumor suppressor in breast cancer, tumorigenesis studies investigating the tumor suppressive role of NDRG2 were irrespective of intrinsic breast cancer subtypes or mainly focused on luminal or basal B breast cancer cell models in vitro [8,9,15,25] and in vivo [12]. To take a deeper look in the biological relevance of NDRG2 regarding the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, we initially analysed mRNA expression in 45 subtype-classified breast tumors, including triple negative (n = 28), HER2-enriched (n = 4), luminal A (n = 7), luminal B (n = 4) breast cancer specimens, and 15 normal breast tissues by real-time PCR. Today, several lines of evidence suggest a potential suppressive role of NDRG2 in tumorigenesis. Current studies in colon [6] and breast carcinoma [12] revealed that NDRG2 antagonizes transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)–mediated cell invasion. In addition, it has been demonstrated that NDRG2 inhibits tumor cell proliferation and increases p53- or hypoxia-mediated apoptosis and its expression is correlated with patient survival and prognosis [4,8,9,28–30]. In a recent study, Ma et al. [31] demonstrated an association of abundant NDRG2 expression with glucose transport in breast carcinoma cells associated with a favorable patients’ outcome.","+Plagiarism of Image

These pigments are found in the choroid and in the RPE of the eye and their absorption properties can influence the reflection spectra of the inner eyewall. Melanin also exists in the sclera, but only in very small amounts [15]. The color of the iris is related to the amount of melanin in the choroid [16], [17]. Choroidal melanocytes from eyes with dark colored irises exhibit a significant higher amount of melanin than from eyes with light colored irises. Menon et al. (1992) demonstrated a higher amount of melanin in the choroid-RPE for brown compared to blue ex-vivo human eyes [15], [18]. Previous measurements of the influence of pigmentation on the reflectance spectra reveal that a higher reflectance is observed for less pigmented eyes compared to more pigmented eyes [11], [19]. In blue eyes, the retina is thus transilluminated with greater portion of light than in brown eyes, where a greater portion is absorbed. Measurements of Kadam et al. (2011) revealed that for the melanin content in the choroid-RPE it is rat > porcine ∼ bovine > pigmented rabbit > albino rabbit [15], which indicates that pigmented eyes have a greater melanin content in the choroid-RPE than non-pigmented eyes.

The secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Southern Biotech, Inc. (Birmingham, USA). Western‐blotting analysis was performed as previously described.45 Briefly, after DNP treatment and gene transfection, the treated cells were disrupted with lysis buffer (1 × PBS, 1% Nonidet P‐40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and freshly added 100 µg/mL PMSF, 10 µg/mL aprotinin, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). These data show that DNP induces cell growth and colony‐forming through miR‐149 high expression. Our previous works have shown that DNP can induce NPC cell migration and invasion.45 To determine the role of miR‐149 in DNP‐induced cell migration and invasion, transwell cell assays were used to detect the migration and invasion of 6‐10B cells with DNP treatment and miR‐149 transfection. In clinical settings, NPC is considered as a highly invasive and metastatic cancer. Both experimental studies and clinical assays indicated that DNP is an important factor of NPC metastasis.25 In the previous works, we found that DNP regulates metastatic adhesion proteins, such as PKP3, clusterin, matrix metallo‐proteinases (MMP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),26, 45 DNP also induces ezrin phosphorylation at Thr567,25 HSP70‐2 expression through increasing HSP70‐2 transcription,27 increases migration and invasion of cells, and promotes tumor metastasis, but their regulatory mechanisms are not entirely clear. In the present study, we probed whether DNP regulates the metastatic adhesion proteins through miRNA, and participates in NPC metastasis. These results suggest that miR‐149 negatively regulates PKP3 expression.

21475622,3068871,Amino Acid Management of Parkinson’s Disease: A Case Study,25092997,4113308,Management of L-dopa overdose in the competitive inhibition state,"5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a metabolite of L-tryptophan and the immediate precursor of serotonin. L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) is a metabolite of L-tyrosine and the immediate precursor of dopamine. Dopamine does not cross the blood–brain barrier.1 L-dopa freely crosses the blood–brain barrier, then is synthesized into dopamine without biochemical feedback inhibition.2 Greater amounts of L-dopa need to be administered if increased synthesis of dopamine in the central nervous system is required. Administration of L-dopa in Parkinson’s disease has been studied since the early 1960s.21 Since then, numerous side effects and adverse reactions have been documented.2,12 Most agree with the Mayo Clinic’s observations that L-dopa is the most effective Parkinson’s disease treatment available. The primary reason for administering carbidopa or benserazide is to decrease daily L-dopa dosing requirement, thereby decreasing L-dopa-induced nausea. During L-dopa monotherapy (administration without a decarboxylase inhibitor), these side effects may prevent the patient from ingesting enough L-dopa to control symptoms.2 The enzyme L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) catalyzes synthesis of serotonin and dopamine from 5-HTP and L-dopa, respectively. This drug-induced inhibition of peripheral AAAD–L-dopa metabolism leaves more L-dopa unmetabolized and available to freely cross the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system. As a result, when carbidopa or benserazide is administered, lower L-dopa daily intake values are required to achieve the same central nervous system results.2 Carbidopa and benserazide also inhibit peripheral metabolism of 5-HTP to serotonin and can cause a drug-induced depletion of peripheral serotonin. Physicians may fail to recognize the signs, symptoms, adverse reactions, and side effects that result from this drug-induced peripheral depletion of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or epinephrine by carbidopa. It is known that inhibition of AAAD with drugs may induce life-threatening side effects, including myocardial infarction, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, agranulocytosis, hemolytic and nonhemolytic anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and hypokalemia (Table 1).2,12 Hinz et al2,12 previously published papers demonstrating that L-dopa-induced nausea can be nutritionally managed by addressing serotonin and dopamine imbalance. Proper administration of 5-HTP with L-dopa effectively controls nausea, eliminates the need for carbidopa, and, as they are no longer required, removes the signs, symptoms, side effects, or adverse reactions associated with carbidopa or benserazide in virtually all patients. Currently, in the US, if a patient experiences a carbidopa side effect, the only available form of L-dopa without carbidopa is a nutritional supplement product containing standardized L-dopa. It is the experience of Hinz et al2,12 that few physicians are aware of the availability of the nutritional supplement form of standardized L-dopa over the counter in the US, and even fewer understand the management of L-dopa-induced nausea without the use of carbidopa. Table 1 is a previously published list of side effects and adverse reactions associated with peripheral depletion of centrally acting monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) due to carbidopa administration.2,12 The current standard of care for Parkinson’s disease is based on the endogenous state perspective. There is no consideration that nausea is caused by the imbalance between the serotonin and dopamine systems. The depletions of serotonin, thiols, L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, and other monoamines associated with the clinical course of Parkinson’s disease, L-dopa monotherapy, and the use of general decarboxylase inhibitors are not addressed (see Table 2).2,12 Under the current standard of care, the etiology of the signs and symptoms associated with these depletions is not adequately recognized, understood, or controlled. The properly balanced competitive inhibition approach avoids the extensive depletion of serotonin, thiols, L-tyrosine, and L-tryptophan that is known to exist with L-dopa monotherapy. It also eliminates the nausea dosing barrier that may occur when L-dopa is administered without the need for a general decarboxylase inhibitor.2,12 A total of 813 medical patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease were queried from a database owned by DBS Labs (Duluth, MN, USA). These were patients who had collected urine samples in the competitive inhibition state and then submitted them for serotonin and dopamine assay followed by OCT2 functional status determination.1,2,13–20 The Parkinson’s disease patients’ diagnostic evaluations were performed under the care of a licensed medical doctor or doctor of osteopathic medicine and then entered as a working diagnosis on submission of laboratory samples.","+Updated to Retraction

Other previous studies have investigated the correlations between initial stroke severity, poststroke functional outcome, and initial serum IGF-1 level.14,15,16,17,18 However, inconsistent results were found for the relationship between serum IGF-1 levels and initial stroke severity, with some studies showing an negative correlation,17,18 while others showed no definite correlation between these two factors.19 Increased poststroke serum IGF-1 levels and the IGF-1/IGF-binding protein 3 ratio were reported to be related to unfavorable functional outcomes at 3 months after stroke.Our study supports previous suggestions of high serum IGF-1 levels exerting neuroprotective effects on stroke severity. A previous study that evaluated the associations of serum IGF-1 levels with stroke severity and outcomes in 221 patients with AIS found a negative correlation between IGF-1 level and initial stroke severity, and that serum IGF-1 levels were lower in patients with severe AIS.18 However, conflicting results have also been reported for the relationship between serum IGF-1 level and stroke severity. Additionally, serum IGF-1 reduces vascular inflammatory responses and atherosclerotic plaque progression, thus acting as a potent neuroprotective compound.25 There have been a few reports of the neuroprotective effect of IGF-1 on initial stroke severity, with serum IGF-1 levels being lower in patients with more-severe stroke. The present bivariate analysis showed that the 3-month functional outcomes differed significantly between the lowest and highest quartiles of the serum IGF-1 level, but the significance of the association was lost in the multivariate models.","+Paper Mill

Prenatal cocaine exposure has profound deleterious effects on the function of dopamine D1 [8, 27–29], GABAergic [30] noradrenergic [31], AMPA [21], NMDA [30, 32] and mGluR1 [6, 33] systems. These findings suggest that prenatal cocaine exposure modifies synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission in multiple systems resulting in enduring brain function changes and cognitive impairments in later life [34, 35]. Studies like ours help identify the molecular underpinnings to the prenatal cocaine-induced brain vulnerabilities and provide preventative therapeutic strategies to treat behavioral abnormalities. Importantly, the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on brain function, synaptic activity and receptor functions assessed postnatally are similar whether cocaine was administered via intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intravenous routes [6, 7, 8, 32, 33, 67], in different species [6, 7, 8, 33] or durations of treatment [6, 8, 30, 32, 33, 67]. Because a single intraperitoneal injection gives similar maternal and fetal plasma half-lives as in human studies [68], the current demonstration that the BDNF-TrkB system and its regulation are modified by intraperitoneal cocaine injection to pregnant rats suggests that similar effects could result from human in utero cocaine exposure.","+Concerns/Issues About Image

Furthermore, A Phe insertion at position 469 of DGAT1 affected the concentrations of seed oil and oleic acid in maize lines [29]. Two DGAT2 gene homologues, CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b of an oleaginous yeast Candida tropicalis SY005 were identified, and five AA variations were found in of the predicted proteins. 2D and 3D structure analysis showed that many structure differences (such as α-helix and β-sheet) resulted in the enzyme activity of CtDGAT2b was higher than that of CtDGAT2a [22].

The up-regulated expression of ST6Gal I was first described in colon cancer, but successively confirmed in other carcinomas of breast, liver, cervix, choriocarcinomas, acute myeloid leukemias and some malignancies of the brain as well [18,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40]. The α2,6 sialylated blood group type 2H catalyzed by ST6Gal I in colon cancer has been reported to be predictive markers of poor prognosis [62]. Animal models also implicate ST6Gal I in tumor metastasis. Neuraminidase treatment of metastatic murine cell lines dramatically decreases the amount of liver metastasis after splenic injection [72]. Despite the well-established link between ST6Gal I and cell migration, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Several groups including us recently demonstrate that ST6Gal I promotes the cell motility by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [37,73]. Also, in vitro studies show that the effects of ST6Gal I on cell migratory response are mediated, at least in part, by the α2,6 sialylation of the β1 integrin because cells deficient in β1 integrin do not exhibit differential invasion upon forced expression of ST6Gal I expression [71,74,75]. Schematic representation of the regulation of α2,6 sialylation expression. The expression level of surface α2,6 sialylation is increased in tumors by several mechanisms. (1) Most commonly, ST6Gal I transcription is regulated by some transcription factors and methylation modification [18,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,101,130]; (2) Some factors like GOLPH3, recently, has been shown to interact with ST6Gal I, thereby modulating the efficiency of the sialylation [73]. (3) In addition, the expression levels of sialic acid transporter could affect α2,6 sialylation expression by regulating the donor substrate reservoir of ST6Gal I [118,119]; (4) The distribution as well as the amount of α2,6 sialic acids on cell surface also depend on the expression pattern of oligosaccharide acceptors [127,128,129]; (5) Further, as observed in many types of tumors, down-regulation of sialidases is usually accompanied by the upregulation of α2,6 sialylation expression [120,121,122,123,124].","+Manipulation of Images

Table 1 shows the sialyltransferases identified in human and most of them have been reported to express abnormally in cancers and are proposed to contribute to cancer progression [16]. The roles of different sialyltransferases in tumor progression have been comprehensively described in several reviews [18,19].

Notably, inhibition or genetic depletion of certain components of neutrophil granules, such as elastase and myeloperoxidase, is protective against diet-induced insulin resistance in mice (9, 12, 13). Moreover, expression of these neutrophil-specific genes is elevated in circulating cells of overweight and obese humans (14). Our data further support the concept that chemoattractant release in response to palmitate depends on pannexin-1 expression in macrophages. Numerous studies have demonstrated that neutrophils are important contributors to high-fat diet–induced insulin resistance through their granule enzymes elastase and myeloperoxidase (9, 12, 13).

25092997,4113308,Management of L-Dopa Overdose in the Competitive Inhibition State,27103805,4827589,Parkinson’s disease managing reversible neurodegeneration,"It is the novel primary hypothesis that if PD symptoms from post-synaptic neuron damage develop, then compromise at any point in the electrical event chain, to include outside the post-synaptic dopamine neuron focus, may exacerbate and mimic PD symptoms and/or disease progression. In PD patients, reversible RNDs may induce PD symptoms which may be inappropriately managed when treated as PN.9–11 Figure 1 illustrates 29 primary system depletions associated with PD and its treatment. An exception to the assumed “more is better concept” was documented in 2014. In the competitive inhibition state, administering too much or too little L-dopa can display exactly the same PD symptoms with identical intensity. The previously documented pill stop technique is required to determine optimal dosing.AADC freely metabolizes L-dopa to dopamine without biochemical feedback regulation. If the daily dosing level reached 24 pills, eight pill per day incremental increases were implemented as needed to achieve symptom relief. Pill stops, under the protocol documented in 2014, were utilized at the caregiver’s discretion and generally were introduced when the daily dosing value was between 24 and 42 pills.9 If the patient was taking any carbidopa/L-dopa preparation, those medications were stopped upon treatment initiation. L-dopa tachyphylaxis has been documented to occur secondary to a B6 RND, dopamine precursor RND and/or a serotonin precursor RND. With symptom relapse pill stops were required to determine if the daily L-dopa dosing value was under dosed or overdosed. Under this approach, in all cases pill stops revealed that the waning symptom control resulted from overdose and less L-dopa was required. Controlling L-dopa-induced nausea with 5-HTP is higher priority than achieving optimal symptom control. Under this approach, if at any point nausea is encountered, symptom optimization needs to be abandoned until nausea has fully resolved secondary to establishing the individualized optimal 5-HTP daily dosing value.9 This research notes the novel finding that as treatment progresses, if other issues related to serotonin and dopamine imbalance such as headache, anxiety, insomnia, etc, occur, 5-HTP may be secondarily titrated within 37.5 to 900 mg per day range. L-cysteine, the immediate glutathione precursor and rate-limiting step in glutathione synthesis, is a one dose fits all approach.10,11,43,58 As previously documented, the optimal adult L-cysteine daily dosing value is 4,500 mg per day in divided doses.9,51,52,55 Due to toxicity of methyl mercury to central nervous system, selenium 400 µg per day is added.","+Updated to Retraction

The growth factors of the bone microenvironment seem to influence bone-metastasis phenotype [1, 2, 4, 25], but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Twist and Snail might activate or repress target genes by employing several direct or indirect mechanisms. Modes of action by Twist1-bhelix-loop-helix (HLH) include direct DNA binding to E-box sequences, and recruitment of co-activators or repressors, but the regulatory outcomes of Twist are also controlled by spatio-temporal expression, phosphorylation and cellular localization [26]. In 1833 cells HGF increased nuclear expression and phosphorylation of Twist1, associated with Wwox down-regulation, differing from TGFβ1 To clarify whether the phenotype of bone metastasis from breast cancer depended on Twist and Snail, we evaluated their expression and intracellular localization in response to HGF and TGFβ1, two typical stimuli of bone microenvironment [1, 2, 4, 25]. As shown in Fig. 1a, HGF rapidly and persistently enhanced Twist-protein level in nuclear extracts of 1833 cells, being ineffective on Snail, and pTwist1/Twist ratio increased between 1 and 8 h, returning thereafter to the starvation value. Further experiments were performed to clarify the molecular mechanisms of nuclear localization and function of Twist and its phosphorylation in response to HGF, by considering the involvement of Akt activity and the role of endogenous or exogenous Wwox on Twist activity (Fig. 2). Twist1 phosphorylation by Akt was studied using LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, since Akt is stimulated by HGF in 1833 cells [25] and it is known to activate Twist in metastasis [28]. As shown in Fig. 2a, in nucleus and cytosol the phosphoTwist1 enhancements after 1-h HGF were prevented by LY294002. Moreover, TGFβ activates ERK2 that directly phosphorylates Snail, leading to its nuclear accumulation, reduced ubiquitination and increased protein half-life [29], while HGF is practically ineffective on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 1833 cells [25]. As in HGF-treated 1833 cells, also in the xenograft model the bone-metastatic cascade invokes E-cadherin emergence [19], consistent with the MET process in response to HGF [2, 25]. Second, our findings suggest for Twist a complex spatio-temporal expression and function, also related to the composition of bHLH-dimer pool [26], with a critical role of Twist as HIF-1 co-activator under Wwox overexpression. Also, we suggest a relationship with the immunohistochemical data of E-cadherin in pair-matched primary-ductal breast carcinoma and bone metastasis from humans, where E-cadherin expression is absent and present, respectively [19]. HGF/Met system is elevated in bone metastasis [2, 25], and might cooperate also in vivo with TGFβ signalling [20], affecting the intercellular adhesive properties and colonization. Recombinant-human HGF and TGF-β1 were from R&D System (Abingdon, UK).","+Unreliable Data

The differentiation of MSC-BM into osteoblasts has well-defined steps in the literature [33], both in healthy cells and in osteoporosis-induced cells [1,34], as well as the correlation of the influence of bioactivity on implant surfaces in the osseointegration process and cell differentiation [35,36,37,38,39]. The cell differentiation and mineralization of senile MSC-BM obtained in this study reinforce the influence of this bioactivity, demonstrating that the topographical characteristics of the PEO-treated surface favor good results, even in cells in an osteoporotic process. Both modified surfaces (SLA and PEO) showed an increase in cell viability over time. However, the SLA surface outnumbered the PEO surface in all time points (3, 7, and 10 days). This correlates with the literature regarding the culture and differentiation of osteoporotic or normal density cells and clinical studies evaluating osseointegration comparing various surface treatments [1,11,34,36,39,44,45]. It is noted that the PEO surface has a beneficial influence on proliferation, being more accelerated, in the process of differentiation into osteoblasts, while the SLA surface is still in the process of cell proliferation [42].","+Duplication of Image

Interestingly, serine 435 has been described as a PKA-mediated ATR site that regulates ATR activity40, and its phosphorylation is decreased in NB cells treated with ALK inhibitors39. We validated these observations in CLB-BAR NB cells, where pATR/ATM substrate motif antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate SUN2 protein. We also explored a combination of ALK and ATR inhibition (employing lorlatinib and BAY 1895344 together), but could see only mild synergistic effects on proliferation of ALK-driven NB cells in vitro (Fig. 5). Thus, although our previous data indicate that ALK signalling regulates ATR phosphorylation on serine 43539, which has been reported as important for ATR activity40, we currently do not fully understand the potential advantages of targeting them in combination.

Tanshinones, including Tanshinone I (Tan I) and Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) can suppress the growth of multiple cancers including those of bladder [15], breast [16–18], cervical [19], liver [20, 21], lung [2–31], pancreatic and prostate cancer (PC) [32–36]. In addition, these bio-active compounds can modulate the growth of astrocytoma [37], endometrial carcinoma [38], mesothelioma [39], melanoma, and leukaemia [40, 41] as well as osteosarcoma [42] and ovarian carcinoma [43–45]. In contrast, Tan IIA has been shown to modulate vascular epidermal growth factor receptor (VEGFR) as well as Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in AGS gastric carcinoma cells [58]. Moreover, Tan I downregulated the activation of the PI3K/Akt/m-TOR pathway leading to a substantial level of apoptosis in breast cancer cells [17]. The molecular mechanisms of Tan I have been briefly depicted in the figure below (Figure 3). Tan IIA in combination with Taxol was found to considerably reduce the resistance of breast cancer MCF-7 (taxol resistant) cells by causing an abrogation of microtubule associated protein [16]. It is interesting to note that both estrogen receptor-responsive MCF-7 and estrogen-independent MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells were found responsive to Tan I, irrespective of their sensitivity to estrogen [17]. In addition, Tan I attenuated the levels of HIF-1α and p-705-STAT3 and the secretion of VEGF in MCF-7 cells [63].","+Investigation by Third Party

However, little is known regarding the expression and clinical significance of miR-493 in OS. For example, a study undertaken by Ueno et al (18) revealed that miR-493 expression was low in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines and that upregulation of miR-493 suppressed bladder cancer cell migration and motility. Furthermore, a study undertaken by Gu et al (19) reported that miR-493 was downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, restoration of miR-493 expression attenuated cell growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo (19).

Specifically, it mentions that JNK and p38 are shuttled by a dimer of Imp3 with either Imp9 or Imp7, a finding directly from the retracted paper. This indicates the citing paper is using the methodology and findings regarding importin-mediated translocation as a basis for comparison or context for ERK5.","[Evidence from Citing Paper: ""Like other MAPK, ERK5 phosphorylates its substrates at S/T-residues immediately preceding a proline. Intriguingly, residue T28 in the ERK5 N-terminal half and residues S421, S433, S496, S731 and T732 in the C-terminal half are not followed by proline, but undergo autophosphorylation. Furthermore, ERK5 is capable of phosphorylating MEK5 at speciﬁc proline-unrelated sites, the residues S129, S137, S142 and S149 [45]. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that the substrate speciﬁcity of ERK5 may diﬀer from that of other MAPK family members. The best characterized ERK5 substrates are nuclear transcription factors, while the known ERK5 cytosolic substrates are very few and include p90RSK kinases [46], the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and the GAP junctional protein CX43 [47]. Although the direct phosphorylation of these substrates by ERK5 has not been demonstrated (except for CX43), it is a fact that ERK5 silencing reduces the phosphorylation of these proteins. Once ERK5 has been activated, it translocates into the nucleus where it phosphorylates and activates a number of transcription factors, of which the MEF-2 family members MEF2A, C and D are the best characterized [39,48,49]. In particular, ERK5 phosphorylates MEK2C in S387, thus increasing its transcriptional activity that in turn enhances c-Jun expression [50]. MEF2D has been shown to be an ERK5-speciﬁc substrate [48,49], whereas the activities of MEF2A and C are controlled by both ERK5 and p38 MAPK [51,52]. As mentioned above, ERK5 contains a MEF2-interacting region and a transcriptional transactivation domain in its C-terminus, both being critical to regulate MEF2 activity [19], as demonstrated by the fact that an ERK5 mutant lacking the C-terminus fails to stimulate MEF2 activity [18]. Besides regulating MEF2, ERK5 controls the transcription of c-MYC, CREB and Sap1a [38,53]. Furthermore, it has been shown that, while both ERK5 and ERK1/2 are capable to phosphorylate c-Fos at S387, ERK5 activation determines c-Fos phosphorylation at additional sites, leading to maximal c-Fos transactivation activity; phosphorylation of these c-Fos sites requires the C-terminal tail of ERK5 [54]. Finally, ERK5 activates other transcription factors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) [55] and probably PPARγ [56] and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) [57]. Importantly, ERK5 possesses an intrinsic transcriptional transactivation activity, which was demonstrated to induce the transcription of Nur77 gene upon calcium signals in T cells [19]. With respect to other downstream pathways of ERK5, it has been reported that it plays a relevant role in regulating cell cycle progression [58], and that there is a link between ERK5 and NFκB in the regulation of cell cycle through the control of G2-M transition and timely entry into mitosis [59]. This function requires ERK5-dependent activation of NFκB via ribosomal S6 kinase 2. Moreover, during mitosis, ERK5 is constitutively phosphorylated and binds and inactivates BIM, a BCL2 family mediator of cell death, suggesting that ERK5 plays a role in the survival of cells in mitosis [60]. 3. Mechanisms of Regulation of ERK5 Nuclear Translocation As reported above, many MAPK exert their ultimate activities in the nucleus. Translocation of MAPK from the cytosol to the nucleus is indeed essential for the regulation of gene transcription and cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, diﬀerentiation and circadian clocks [61,62]. Small molecules including proteins can enter the nucleus by simple diﬀusion through the nuclear pore, while proteins with a molecular mass larger than around 60 kDa, including many MAPK, are actively transported from one side to the other of the nuclear envelope by nuclear transporters. Regarding the latter, for example, ERK1/2 are shuttled by Importin-7 (Imp7) [63,64], while JNK and p38 are shuttled by a dimer of Imp3 with either Imp9 or Imp7 [65]. With respect to ERK5 nuclear translocation, several mechanisms of regulation have been described (Figure 1).""] [Evidence from Cited Paper: ""We show that this translocation involves three β-like importins, importins 3, 7, and 9 (Imp3/7/9). Knockdown of these importins inhibits the nuclear translocation of the MAPKs and, thereby, activation of their transcription factor targets. We further demonstrate that the translocation requires the stimulated formation of heterotrimers composed of Imp3/Imp7/MAPK or Imp3/Imp9/MAPK. JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK bind to either Imp7 or Imp9 upon stimulated posttranslational modification of the two Imps, while Imp3 joins the complex after its stimulation-induced phosphorylation. Once formed, these heterotrimers move to the nuclear envelope, where importin 3 remains, while importins 7 and 9 escort the MAPKs into the nucleus. These results suggest that β-like importins are central mediators of stimulated nuclear translocation of signaling proteins and therefore add a central level of regulation to stimulated transcription.""]",FALSE

While there are multiple sources of ROS in aging and associated cardiovascular disorders, recent studies have established a mechanistic role of sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na/K-ATPase) signaling cascade in the exacerbation of oxidative stress [11,12,13]. Xie and his group discovered the scaffolding and signaling function of Na/K-ATPase, apart from its pumping function, over two decades ago. The cellular generation of ROS has been demonstrated to be attenuated by the administration of pNaKtide. In vitro and in vivo studies have provided significant evidence suggesting a strong potency of pNaKtide in ameliorating multiple clinical disorders including, but not limited to, experimental uremic cardiomyopathy, steatohepatitis, and atherosclerosis [12,18]. The recent studies effectively characterize the therapeutic potential of pNaKtide, by antagonizing Na/K-ATPase-mediated amplification of ROS signaling, subsequently preventing or reversing the diseased phenotype and restoring metabolic homeostasis in a dose-dependent manner, in murine models [11]. The ongoing research and future studies, on the effectiveness of pNaKtide, will potentially bridge the gap between the rodents and the humans by demonstrating its safe administration, further allowing the clinical use of pNaKtide and possibly reversing the clinical disorders. The demonstration that the Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop plays a key role in the generation and amplification of ROS highlights the importance of investigating its role in diseases such as obesity that are intimately linked to high levels of oxidative stress [13,22]. The Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop has been shown to induce adipocyte dysfunction in murine preadipocyte (3T3-L1) cell lines, and pNaKtide attenuated not only the oxidant stress but also adipogenesis [11]. A recent study showed that 16-month-old C57BL/6 mice fed a high fat diet significantly increased body weight, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat, as compared to young and old mice fed a normal chow diet.","+Updated to Retraction

Likewise, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling has also been proven to play a crucial role during osteoclast formation (Ouyang et al., 2014; Qiao et al., 2016). Various reports showed the underlying interaction between MAPK and NF-κB (Dhawan and Richmond, 2002; Papa et al., 2004). Representative candidates for antiresorptive reagents included bisphosphonate and denosumab. Although desirable effects of anti-osteoclastogenesis were shown after treatment with antiresorptive reagents, patients could suffer from inevitable side effects (Qiao et al., 2016), which led to the exacerbation of illness significantly.

This interaction is important for NER enhancement and attenuating UV-induced mutagenesis (Jarrett et al., 2016). Given the central role of XPA and ATR in NER, the discovery of AKAP12 as a scaffold protein that facilitates XPA’s transport to damage introduces a novel regulatory mechanism for NER. In so doing, AKAP12 provides an appropriate “microenvironment” to enable interactions between ATR and XPA and optimize assembly of DNA repair complexes. It is uncertain how AKAP12 enhances NER; however, we provide evidence that AKAP12 promotes the interaction between XPA and ERCC1-XPF (Jarrett et al., 2016). As ERCC1-XPF is the endonuclease that is catalyzes the 5′ incision step of NER, we reasoned AKAP12 might be functionally necessary for cAMP-enhancement of ERCC1-XPF incision. As NER is the DNA repair pathway that is active against helical-distorting lesions, we tested whether MC1R-cAMP signaling may affect the repair of other types of damage that are NER-relevant. Since platinum-containing chemotherapeutics form helix-distorting lesions via both intra- and interstrand crosslinks, we evaluated the effect of cAMP signaling on melanocyte DNA repair responses to platinum compounds (Jarrett et al., 2016). By using an intrastrand lesion-specific cisplatin-DNA antibody that recognizes the 1,2-d(GpG) cross-links, we were able to measure the repair of cisplatin-damaged DNA.","+Original Data not Provided

Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), a modern imaging method for investigation of tissue microvascular perfusion in real time, was demonstrated to be feasible in the differentiation of benign from malignant lymph nodes (2). The qualitative evaluation and differential diagnosis of lymph nodes are fundamental in the diagnosis because they influence not only the assessment of the oncologic stage and prognosis, but also the selection of appropriate invasive tests and treatment monitoring strategies (3). Recent literature has indicated the possibility of differentiating malignant nodes from benign ones by observing the enhanced patterns on CEUS. All authors agree that “hilar normal”, i.e., a single vascular pole around hilum with linear and regular branches, is a sign of benignity; in contrast, multiple peripheral poles with distortion and displacement of the internal vessels—these being responsible for the “inhomogeneous spotted or cycle-like enhancement”—generally indicate malignancy (2,6).

Moreover, CITED2 and UPF1 were identified as direct downstream targets of miR-1468 in HCC cells, and mediated the functional effects of miR-1468 in HCC, resulting in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)/AKT signaling activation. In clinical samples of HCC, miR-1468 inversely correlated with the levels of CITED2 and UPF1, which were confirmed to be down-regulated in HCC. Restoration of CITED2 or UPF1 expression at least partially abolished the biological effects of miR-1468 on HCC cells.

In addition to this, lncRNA-PVT1 can affect autophagy by regulating various signaling pathways and biological processes [25,26]. Thus, lncRNA-PVT1 may be involved in the autophagic process of acinar cells in SAP. SAP induced the upregulation of autophagy in acinar cells in vitro and in vivo. LncRNA-PVT1, located at 8q24.21, is upregulated in many cancers and associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy [25,26,30]. Our real-time PCR and RNA FISH results showed that lncRNA-PVT1 was also significantly upregulated in the cytoplasm of injured acinar cells, in both in vitro and in vivo assays.","+Manipulation of Images

After UVB irradiation, corneal epithelial ROS-generating oxidases contribute to the antioxidant/prooxidant imbalance, in favour of prooxidants, and to the oxidative stress in the cornea2–7. The antioxidant/prooxidant enzymatic imbalance is followed by the protease/antiprotease imbalance in the corneal epithelium. Moreover, H2-rich saline protected the retina against glutamate-induced excitotoxic injury in guinea pigs28. In the anterior eye segment, H2 prevented corneal endothelial damage in phacoemulsification cataract surgery29 and suppressed oxidative stress in the cornea of experimental animals evoked by corneal alkali burns, using a lower30 as well as higher7 concentration of alkali. As already mentioned, in this study H2 prevented or highly reduced the oxidative damage of UVB irradiated corneas, leading to the restoration of transparency.Oxidative stress has been found to be implicated in the pathogenesis of various corneal injuries and diseases, such as corneal irradiation with UVB rays, corneal alkali burns, dry eye disease, keratoconus, Fuchs’ endothelial dystrophy and bullous keratopathy7–9,30–33. The expressions of MDA (a marker of lipid peroxidation) and NT (a marker of oxidative stress) were described in diseased corneas in the cells of individual corneal layers. The small amount of missing solution was refilled with PBS and the bottle tightly closed. For the measuring of the concentration of the dissolved molecular hydrogen in PBS (pH 7.2 continually checked by pH meter) the Trustlex ENH-1000 (TRUSTLEX, Kyoto, Japan) was used as the primary measuring device (see Cejka et al.7 in detail). In brief: The Trustlex ENH-1000 is an original Japanese made device for measuring dissolved hydrogen and it displays the dissolved hydrogen by means of hydrogen reduction method in ppm units (wt of H2/vol of solution). The device is calibrated directly in ppm (the readings are in ppm). For the morphological evaluation of corneas, haematoxylin-eosin staining of post-fixed cryostat sections was employed. Changes of corneal optical properties after the injury and during healing were evaluated by measuring the central corneal thickness (taken as an index of corneal hydration) (see Cejka et al.,7 in detail).

MiR-509-5p has been linked to many human diseases, especially cancers [7–10]. For instance, miR-509-5p exerts a tumor-suppressive effect by down-regulating the expression of TRIB2 in osteosarcoma [7]. MiR-509-5p is also remarkably down-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines, while augmented expression of miR-509-5p represses the proliferation, migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by targeting MDM2 [8], and importantly MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 contributes to the development of PAH [11]. MiR-509-5p is recently demonstrated to exhibit crucial regulatory functions in several types of tumors, and its specific role in different tumors is heterogeneous. For instance, in osteosarcoma and pancreatic cancer, miR-509-5p is capable of suppressing proliferation and migration of cancer cells, exerting a tumor-suppressive role [7,8], whereas in papillary thyroid cancer, miR-509-5p is capable of targetedly down-regulating SFRP1 to potentiate proliferation and invasion of papillary thyroid cancer cells, exhibiting a cancer-promoting role [20]. In the present study, we explored the expression characteristics and biological function of miR-509-5p in PAH. The expression of circulating miR-509-5p was demonstrated to be aberrantly lowly expressed in the serum of PAH patients, and it was also underexpressed in hypoxia-treated PASMCs. Furthermore, it was revealed that miR-509-5p repressed the proliferation and migration of PASMCs and facilitated their apoptosis, consistent with its inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and migration in osteosarcoma and pancreatic cancer [7,8].

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), the most common type of OSCC, PRNCR1 over-expression was reported in primary tumors as well as in cancer cell lines (Liu et al. 2021; Lin et al. 2020). Following PRNCR1 knockdown reduced tumor phenotypes of cancer cells like proliferation, migration, and invasion suggested the association of the lncRNA in disease pathogenesis. Moreover after PRNCR1 knockdown, TSCC cells also showed increased apoptosis in vitro and reduced growth in tumor xenograft (Lin et al. 2020). In oral cancer, PRNCR1 was found to exert its oncogenic impact through sponging target miRNAs (Fig. 3E). Thus, over-expression of miR-326 and subsequent down-regulation of FSCN-1 in oral tumor seemed to be an effective strategy of disease management and this might be achieved through targeting PRNCR1 by novel therapeutic measures. In TSCC cells, PRNCR1 was found to attenuate mir-944 and thereby up-regulate expression of HOXB5 (Lin et al. 2020), a transcription factor over-expressed in head and neck tumors; also in oral cells, HOXB5 was found to involve in the transcriptional up-regulation of EGFR and thereby mediate the activation of AKT/Wnt/β-catenin signaling axis (Lee et al. 2020) associated with the cell cycle regulation (Vadlakonda et al. 2013). Moreover, although tumor-suppressive role of miR-944 was reported in breast and colorectal cancers (Flores-Pérez et al. 2016; Wen et al. 2017), the miRNA was found to be over-expressed and play an oncogenic role in cervical carcinoma (Park et al. 2019) and interestingly in tobacco-induced oral cancer (Peng et al. 2020). Higher PRNCR1 level in ER and Her2-negative breast tumors raised the candidature of the lncRNA as target for novel therapeutic with an aim for better management of the disease subtype. In one investigation, malignant tongue tumors were categorized as of high and low PRNCR1 levels taking the median value of the expression as a cut-off; significant association of high PRNCR1 level in tumor was found with parameters of disease progression like increased tumor size, higher clinical stage, and incidence of lymph node metastasis (Lin et al. 2020). Furthermore, significantly shorter overall survival of the patients having high PRNCR1 level in tumors than those with low expression level indicated potential of the lncRNA in predicting disease prognosis.Therefore, in PRNCR1, impact of the SNPs in connection to all possible functional aspects of the lncRNA need to be analyzed in details to explore the molecular basis for association of the variants with cancer susceptibility. Frequent over-expression of PRNCR1 in malignancies and its association with adverse tumor phenotypes and poor patient outcome suggested importance of the lncRNA as a potential target for novel cancer therapeutics (Guo et al. 2019; Abdollahzadeh et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2016). Oncogenic lncRNAs are commonly targeted at post-transcriptional level by RNA interference (RNAi), antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and morpholino ASOs (block RNA function sterically) for therapeutic purpose; however, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transcriptional silencing of gene locus is also considered as an important strategy (Arun et al. 2018). In cell line-based experiments, PRNCR1 was knocked down post-transcriptionally by siRNA in breast cancer (Pang et al. 2019) and by ASO in colorectal cancer (Yang et al. 2016). In oral cancer, siRNA-mediated knock-down of PRNCR1 was successfully accomplished in vitro as well as in vivo system, but restricted to the xenograft tumor model only (Lin et al. 2020). However, xenograft tumors, as developed from cultured human cancer cell line, may not have representative histological architecture and cellular complexity of native primary tumors (Becher and Holland 2006).","+Paper Mill

In addition, in another study, inhibition of MnSOD was found to suppress various EMT-related transcription factors and MMPs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells [32]. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family proteins such as MMP-9 and MMP-2 play an important role in cancer progression by regulating invasion, proliferation, and metastasis [33,34,35,36,37]. As previously reported, CXCR7/4 can be stimulated by its ligand, CXCL12, which can then induce the JAK/STAT pathway and EMT processes [17,18,19,20,21,26]. In addition, the EMT process can also be regulated by MnSOD [30,31,32]. Our findings confirm that the antimetastatic activities of LEE were mediated primarily through the inhibition of CXCR7/4 and the EMT process in breast cancer cells. In addition to the inhibition of CXCR7/4 expression by LEE, it was confirmed by wound healing and Boyden chamber assays that LEE could significantly suppress the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. In addition, activity of MMPs, known to be related to the EMT process [32,33,34,35,36], was analyzed by zymography, and it was observed that LEE reduced the level of MMP-9/2 in breast cancer cell culture medium.

Moreover, in-vivo results revealed that HCC cell-derived exosomal DLX6-AS1 enhanced lung metastasis through induction of M2 macrophage polarization.

Cytokinin-induced improvements in these fluorescence parameters could be correlated with the enhanced number of active reaction centers and restoration of D1 protein due to antioxidation mechanisms supported by the antisenescing function of cytokinins [36]. The photosynthetic yield parameters, such as PHI(Po), PHI(Eo), and PSIo, denoting the proportion of energy absorbed by chlorophyll molecules associated with PSII, were susceptible to Cu stress, as evidenced by the decrease in the values of PHI(Po), PHI(Eo) and PSIo as compared to controls. However, at the same time, cytokinin application to the cotyledonary leaves of castor plants subjected to CuSO4 resulted in the enhancement of energy flux parameters. Similar to our results, a cytokinin-mediated enhancement in energy flux parameters in Trigonella seedlings subjected to Cd stress was observed by Bashri and co-workers [36].

This supports the concept of exosomal miR-mediated communication between and towards β-cells [47] (Figure 1). For instance, human T lymphocyte-derived exosomes (T-EX), which transfer miR-155, induce apoptosis of β cells and promote type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in mice [41]. Apparently, the miR-155/MAFB axis plays a critical role in controlling β cell homeostasis. In contrast, He et al. [47] investigated the impact of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-EX) administrated to T2DM rats and high-glucose-treated primary islets. Their results showed that MSC-EX and especially miR-146a therein reversed diabetic β cell de-differentiation and improved β cell insulin secretion [47]. Furthermore, human umbilical MSC-EX inhibited streptozotocin (STZ)-induced β cell apoptosis and restored insulin-secretion in a model of T2DM [48]. MEX miR-148a directly targets TP53 mRNA and thereby suppresses p53 [131,132], the guardian of the genome [133,134], which interacts with approximately 1/10th of human gene promoters [135]. p53 modifies the expression of target genes activating cell cycle progression (CDKN1A) [136,137], IGF-1 and mTORC1 signaling (IGF1R, PTEN, TSC2) [137,138,139,140,141], LKB1-AMPK signaling (STK11, SESN1, SESN2) [142,143], autophagy (ATG5, BECN1) [144,145], and apoptosis (FOXO1A, FOXO3A, TNFRSF10B) [137,146], promoting cell survival (BIRC5) [137,147,148,149]. Other highly conserved suppressors of p53 are miR-125b [150], detected in human, bovine, porcine, and sheep MEX [22,129,151,152,153,154] as well as miR-30d and miR-25 [155], identified in human and porcine MEX as well [151,154,155,156,157,158]. In fact, downregulation of PPARGC1A expression in human islets by siRNA reduced insulin secretion by 41% [244]. Moreover, miR-148a targets carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1A) [245], a central regulator of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation [246,247]. Thus, MEX miR-148a-mediated suppression of PPARGC1A and CPT1A in β cells may impair mitochondrial function and ATP-dependent insulin secretion, whereas the termination of MEX signaling may enhance mitochondrial function, insulin secretion, and β cell maturation. The consecutive switch to β cells to functional maturity may result from the weaning-related loss of MEX miR signaling [36]. Our hypothesis is supported by recent observations of bidirectional exosome traffic of β cells communicating with various distant cells and tissues of the body [37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47].

Lam] in Southern Ethiopia,"Vermicompost (VC) is the worms’ casting; a highly nutritive organic fertilizer and powerful growth promoter and among the strategy of organic carbon buildup in the soil [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. Earthworms along with associated microbes facilitate the decomposition of organic materials and make nutrients available to plants [19]. Vermicompost has been recognized as an effective means for improving soil aggregation, structure and fertility, moisture-holding capacity, and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) [14]. This imbalance may lead to an increase in non-marketable yield. Even at the highest rate, the vermicompost alone might not be able to supply the required amount of K to undertake its crucial role during photosynthesis, translocation and storage of assimilates as explained by Refs. [19,21,67]. Gao et al. [68] reported low stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) accompanied by decreased intercellular CO2 concentration from sweet potatoes not supplied with K fertilizer. In line with this finding, Latha et al. [11] noted that soils with an inadequate supply of nutrients favor the lignification of adventitious roots leading to the formation of pencil-like roots and more vine growth.","+Fake Peer Review

Neural stem cells (NSCs), whether derived from embryonic, fetal, or adult tissues, are a class of multipotent cells that can give rise to various neural phenotypes.135 Thus, their differentiation capacity makes them an intriguing transplantable cell type for stroke therapy with the disease pathology linked to a defective neurovascular unit. Displayed by their upregulation after stroke insult,136 SGZ and SVZ serve as major brain tissue sources of NSCs.137 Although NSCs are initially grown in culture with basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor,137,138 removal of these cytokines allows NSCs to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.135 Concerning their therapeutic benefits, NSCs induce angiogenesis139 and neurogenesis138 in stroke models. Based on previous studies, overexpression of miR-381, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), Nox4-generated superoxide levels,135,140,141 and ephrinB2 and Jagged1142 may influence the activity of NSCs. Also important to note, NSC-associated exosomes can regulate inflammation by releasing neuroprotective compounds such as VEGF, NGF, BDNF, and neurotrophins.","+Fake Peer Review

In our institution, after surgical resection, we routinely recommend patients with AM to consult a radiotherapy specialist for further treatment. To explore the factors that exert more influence on these patients, especially to find those factors that contribute to radiosensitivity, we investigated differentially expressed miRNAs. Recent studies have revealed that differences in miRNA expression could influence radiosensitivity in a series of tumors, including, but not limited to, glioblastoma (GBM), breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and cervical cancer (14–18).

Since then, our group has demonstrated multiple lines of evidence suggesting the involvement of Na/K-ATPase signaling in various disease models ranging from obesity to cancer, including our recently published data in aging models [14,15,16]. These studies target Na/K-ATPase signaling cascade with the goal of developing therapeutic options for the clinical disorders, which are all associated to systemic and cellular redox imbalance [12,17,18]. Consistent with previous studies, protein carbonylation and Src phosphorylation increased in our in vitro and in vivo aging models and decreased following pNaKtide treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that inhibition of Na/K-ATPase signaling was able to reverse oxidation-induced senescence and apoptosis at both the morphological and molecular level [16]. Obesity is regarded as an excess accumulation of adipose tissue, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30. A recent study showed that 16-month-old C57BL/6 mice fed a high fat diet significantly increased body weight, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat, as compared to young and old mice fed a normal chow diet. These levels were attenuated after the administration of pNaKtide [16]. This exemplifies the importance of utilizing Na/K-ATPase signaling as a therapeutic target in an effort to ameliorate aging and obesity. However, the Na/K-ATPase antagonism through pNaKtide attenuated this cardiac damage. Protein carbonylation and Src phosphorylation, in vivo, suggests the importance of the Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop in aggravating the detrimental cardiovascular damage in aging [16]. Extensive research on the manifestation of biological aging process has presented with various pharmacological interventions that can improve longevity and battle the underlying mechanisms operant in age-associated cellular senescence and apoptosis.","+Unreliable Data

In pancreatic cancer (5), cervical cancer (6), glioblastoma (7), and osteosarcoma (8), high expression of Fibulin-3 suggests a poor prognosis. However, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (9), breast cancer (10), non-small cell lung carcinoma (11), and endometrial cancer (12), Fibulin-3 was found to have potential tumor-suppressive effects. Staining was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions provided in the kit. Cervical cancer tissue sections (Fibulin-3-positive) were used as positive control (6), and phosphate-buffered saline was used as the blank control. Fibulin-3, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin were positive for brownish yellow particles in the cell membrane and cytoplasm, and Snail was positive for brownish yellow particles in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Fibulin-3 significantly affects the expression of several key factors in EMT. In some cancer cell lines, an interaction mechanism of Fibulin-3 and EMT has been suggested (6,8). In pancreatic adenocarcinomas, Fibulin-3 binds EGFR, causing autophosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr-992 and Tyr-1068 and subsequent phosphorylation of AKT at Thr-308 and ERK at Thr-202 and Tyr-204, thus accelerating the growth of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (5). In colon carcinoma, Fibulin-3 promotes cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion through a mechanism correlated with p38α and p38β activation (28). Fibulin-3 has been shown to facilitate cervical cancer cell development and metastasis by activating the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signal transduction pathway (6).

Previous studies found that, under hypoxia, circRNAs may become important biomarkers of lung cancer, since they participate in the malignant progression of lung cancer, including metastasis, cell proliferation, tumor growth and drug resistance) (23,46–48). In lung cancer tissues, HIF-α expression was significantly elevated compared with that in adjacent normal lung control tissues, suggesting the existence of tumor hypoxia during the development of lung cancer (23,46,47). HIF, a marker of hypoxia, activates downstream oncogene transcription containing hypoxia response elements to regulate tumor metabolism and metastasis (78). HIF may also lead to chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance through a variety of mechanisms (48,79). Therefore, in the clinic, HIF expression is associated with poor prognosis and treatment recurrence. However, platinum drug sensitivity is repressed with chemoresistance progression. Compared with that in normoxic cells, the expression of circASXL1 and crcAKT3 was upregulated, while the expression of miR-206 and miR-516B-5p was downregulated, in hypoxic lung cancer tissues and cells (48,81). Functionally, knocking out the circASXL1 and circAKT3 genes increased the sensitivity of cells to cisplatin (DDP), inhibited HIF-1α-dependent glycolysis, and weakened the increase in chemotherapy resistance in ASXL1 and AKT3-induced lung cancer cells. Notably, the knockdown-mediated inhibition of cisplatin resistance and glycolysis were reversed in lung cancer cells with inhibitors of miR-206 or miR-516b-5p. In addition, the circASXL1/miR-206 or miR-516B-5p/STAT3 axis could inhibit lung cancer growth in vivo (48,81).
