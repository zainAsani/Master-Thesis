15934135,17250953,"1alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced DNA methylation suppresses the human CYP27B1 gene",Yes,No,"1: Expression of CYP27B1 is negatively regulated by Vitamin D[1,25(OH)2D3] (Murayama et al., 2004; Murayama et al., 1998; Takeyama et al., 1997). We recently reported that a bHLHtype activator, VDR-interacting repressor (VDIR), directly binds to the negative Vitamin D response element (1nVDRE) in the human CYP27B1 gene promoter, thus activating its transcription (Fig. 1) (Murayama et al., 2004). However, ligand-induced association between VDR and VDIR results in ligand-induced repression (transrepression) of the CYP27B1 gene expression. This transrepression is associated with VDIR switching from a co-activator complex containing histone acetyltransferase (HAT) to a co-repressor complex containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) (Murayama et al., 2004). 2:Transrepression at the CYP27B1 promoter was monitored in transfection assays using a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of a human CYP27B1 gene promoter segment (âˆ¼700 bp upstream region of the transcription start site) containing two consensus 1nVDRE sequences recognized by VDIR. Using gene-specific RNAi, we found that endogenous VDR, VDIR and WSTF are involved in the ligand-induced suppression of the CYP27B1 gene promoter (Fig. 2A) that is consistent with previously shown physical association of these three factors (Kitagawa et al., 2003; Murayama et al., 2004). 3:To test whether WSTF was recruited to VDIR via liganded VDR in the nuclei of living cells, we performed a ChIP assay on the endogenous CYP27B1 gene promoter. In agreement with previous reports (Kitagawa et al., 2003; Murayama et al., 2004), VDIR was constitutively bound to the 1nVDRE (Fig. 2B). As WSTF RNAi remarkably attenuated the promoter occupancy by VDR in the absence of ligand, WSTF appeared to facilitate the binding of unliganded VDR at the 1nVDRE (Fig. 2B). 4:Histone deacetylation by recruited HDACs to VDR/VDIR at the 1nVDRE is a critical step for remodeling chromatin structure at the CYP27B1 gene promoter in VDR-mediated transrepression (Murayama et al., 2004). However, TSA (a HDAC inhibitor) could not fully abrogate 1,25 (OH)2D3-induced transrepression (Fig. 4A), suggesting that an additional mechanism may contribute to this transcriptional repression. 5:We have shown that the CYP27B1 gene nVDRE is composed of two E-box like motifs (Murayama et al., 2004). This E-box like motif(s), serving as a VDIR binding site, also appears to confer a negative response to 1,25(OH)2D3 at other VDR target gene promoters (Kim et al., in press). 6:It has been suggested that ligand-unbound VDR/RXR on the VDRE mainly associates with a HDAC complex to repress target genes (Murayama et al., 2004). According to this model of a positive VDRE, ligand binding leads to co-repressor dissociation from VDR. In contrast, the WINAC assists recruitment of HDAC co-repressor complex in VDIR-mediated transrepression on a negative VDRE (Fujiki et al., 2005).",Others,Dependent,Yes,>1,Mol Cell Endocrinol,2007,1/26/2007,10.1016/j.mce.2006.12.014,+Investigation by Journal/Publisher +Investigation by Company/Institution +Duplication of/in Image +Concerns/Issues About Data,"Data, Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process","+Manipulation of Images

The results indicate that CDF significantly inhibited cell survival in a dose-dependent manner in AsPC-1, MiaPaCa-2 cells, and MiaPaCa-2 tumor sphere cells (Fig. 1A). These results suggests that CDF could exert a pronounced cell growthâ€“inhibitory effect on pancreatic cancer cell growth and proliferation, which is consistent with our previously published reports (17, 18)*. 4:To determine the mRNA expression of EZH2, Notch-1, EpCAM, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4, 2 mg of total RNAs extracted from each sample (pancreatic cancer cells of xenograft tumor sample) were used for reverse transcription (RT) reaction in 20 mL of reaction volume using a reverse transcription system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

While the roles of Mybbp1a in these repressor complexes remain unclear, it may likely serve similar epigenetic and cellular functions. 2:We sought to further dissect the molecular basis of Mybbp1aâ€™s inhibitory role in rDNA gene transcription. Given the requirement of HDACs in maintaining an inactive state of rDNA promoters [26,30], and the reported association of Mybbp1a with several HDACs-containing co-repressor complexes [10]*, we next aimed to assess whether HDACs contribute to Mybbp1a-mediated rDNA gene silencing.

Furthermore, several studies demonstrated that FOXM1 can regulate cyclin and CDK expression in human pancreatic cancer cells, as downregulation of FOXM1 expression inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth by suppressing cyclin B, cyclin D1, Cdk2, and Cdc25a expression [78,79]*. 2:In addition, blockade of FOXM1 expression in human prostate cancer cells can upregulate p27 protein expression and cause a reduction in and reduce cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth on soft agar [71]. Moreover, Wang et al. [78]* found that downregulation of FOXM1 expression decreased the pancreatic cancer cell population in S phase and inhibited the growth of the cells by increasing p21 and p27 expression. 3:Moreover, FOXM1 overexpression increased VEGF expression in gastric and breast cancer cells, whereas blockade of FOXM1 expression did the opposite [88,90]. Recently, Wang et al. [78]* found that downregulation of FOXM1 expression reduced VEGF expression in pancreatic cancer cells, resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis. Consistent with these findings, we demonstrated that promotion of pancreatic cancer angiogenesis by FOXM1 was directly and strongly correlated with transactivation of VEGF. 4:Authors have documented a similar role for FOXM1 in the regulation of MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9 expression as well as cell migration and invasion in other malignancies, including colorectal and breast carcinoma [13,97]. Consistent with these findings, recent studies indicated that FOXM1 contributes to pancreatic cancer invasion by enhancing MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression and that suppression of FOXM1 expression leads to reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in pancreatic cancer cells, which are associated with an overall decrease in cancer cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis [78,79]*. 5:In addition to regulation of the expression of proteolysis-related genes, several studies have demonstrated that FOXM1 promotes pancreatic tumor invasion and metastasis by contributing to angiogenesis and pancreatic cancer cell EMT [78]*. In summary, these findings provide evidence that FOXM1 promotes pancreatic cancer metastasis via regulation of multiple steps in the process in tumor invasion and metastasis. 6:They also confirmed that FOXM1 is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer cell lines.

Therefore, we investigated whether genistein could regulate FoxM1 signaling pathways using molecular and mechanistic approaches in this study. 5:Our previous study has shown that MMP-9 was regulated by FoxM1 in pancreatic cancer (7), and since we found that genistein can down-regulate the expression of FoxM1, we tested whether genistein could decrease MMP-9 activity as assessed by ELISA. We found about 2-3-fold decrease in the activity of MMP-9 in genistein-treated pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig.5A). These results are consistent with our observation on the down-regulation of FoxM1, which indeed leads to the down-regulation of both MMP-9 levels and its activity as reported earlier (7)*. 6:To further investigate whether genistein has any effect on VEGF, whose expression is transcriptionally regulated by FoxM1 (7,21,24)*, ELISA was performed to examine the activity of VEGF. We found that genistein could lead to a decrease in the levels of VEGF secreted in the culture medium (Fig. 5B). 7:FoxM1 signaling has been demonstrated to maintain a balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting that abnormal activation of FoxM1 gene is one of the â€œhallmarksâ€� of human malignancies (9). Many studies have shown over-expression of FoxM1 gene in human cancer cells and tissues, including pancreatic cancer (7,10,12,14,25â€“27)*, and this emerging evidence suggests that inactivation of FoxM1 by novel approaches could have a significant impact in cancer therapy.",Intro & M&M & Res & Discuss,Dependent,Yes,>1,Pharm Res,2010,4/1/2010,10.1007/s11095-010-0106-x,+Misconduct by Author +Misconduct - Official Investigation and/or Finding +Investigation by Company/Institution +Falsification/Fabrication of Image +Falsification/Fabrication of Data +Duplication of/in Image,"Authorship, Images",,,Uses_Results,"The citing paper explicitly discusses how genistein down-regulates FoxM1 and its downstream genes, which were originally identified and characterized in the retracted paper.

In SKBR3 cells expressing shRNAs targeting RNF41 or control proteins (RFP or luciferase), we assessed HER3 levels after treatment with a negative control IgG or IgG 95. In the presence of the negative control IgG, cells expressing RNF41 shRNA exhibited higher HER3 levels than those expressing control shRNAs (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with previous reports (45, 46)* and with on-target shRNA activity. Moreover, down-regulation of HER3 levels was attenuated in cells Because RNF41 shRNAs attenuated the anti-proliferative activity of IgG 95, we tested whether they also attenuated the effects of IgG 95 on the ubiquitination and down-regulation of HER3. In SKBR3 cells expressing shRNAs targeting RNF41 or control proteins (RFP or luciferase), we assessed HER3 levels after treatment with a negative control IgG or IgG 95. In the presence of the negative control IgG, cells expressing RNF41 shRNA exhibited higher HER3 levels than those expressing control shRNAs (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with previous reports (45, 46)* and with on-target shRNA activity. Moreover, down-regulation of HER3 levels was attenuated in cells. 2: In summary, our data highlight a functional contribution of RNF41 to the anti-proliferative activity of IgG 95 in SKBR3 cells and support a dual role for this E3 ligase in the regulation of HER3. First, as also described previously (44, 45, 47)*, RNF41 regulates resting HER3 levels, as knockdown of RNF41 results in an increase in total HER3. 3: In HER2-amplifiedSKBR3cells,RNF41playsthedualroleof controlling both total HER3 levels and antibody-mediated degradation. We predict that these two functions may render RNF41-depleted cancer cell lines more aggressive as a result of higherHER3levels,asseenelsewhere(45,46),andlesssensitive to antibodies like IgG 95 that depend on RNF41 for their efficacy, especially in the context of HER2 amplification where HER3signalingisdriveninaligand-independentmanner.Conversely, given that RNF41 knockdown increases the proliferative response to NRG1 (46), cancers exhibiting low RNF41 and ligand-dependent signaling would likely respond to NRG1 competitive anti-HER3 antibodies. 5: Based on our observations that IgG 95 induces ubiquitination and down-regulation of HER3, we furthered explored the mechanism of IgG 95 function by performing a UPS-targeted functional genomic screen and found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41 is at least partially responsible for the anti-proliferative effects of IgG 95. Previous studies have found that overexpression of RNF41 leads to ubiquitination and down-regulation of HER3 (44 â€“47) and that NRG1 promotes RNF41-mediated HER3 ubiquitination (58).","Discussion, Other",Dependent,Yes,>1,J Biol Chem,2019,12/8/2018,10.1074/jbc.RA118.004420,+Investigation by Journal/Publisher +Fake Peer Review,Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process,,,,,,,,,TRUE

The PX domain binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) enables the association of SNXs with PtdInsP-enriched elements of the endocytic network. In this manner, SNXs redirect protein cargos for retrieval or degradation, playing important roles in protein intracellular trafficking and signaling. SNX1 was the first described mammalian SNX, and it was shown to interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a yeast-two hybrid screen [3].

20388782,22637745,Re-expression of miR-200 by novel approaches regulates the expression of PTEN and MT1-MMP in pancreatic cancer,Yes,No,"1:Besides the deregulation of MT1-MMP, the loss of expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is a ubiquitous tumor suppressor gene, has been shown to correlate with tumor aggressiveness and was also associated with up-regulation of miRNA expression such as miR-21 (12,13)*. Additionally, over-expression of MT1-MMP was found to be associated with loss of PTEN expression in prostate cancer cells derived from mice through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (14); whereas in renal cell carcinoma, loss of PTEN induces HIF-2Î± transcriptional activity through antagonism of PI3K signaling (15). 2:Emerging evidence suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs), highly conserved and small non-coding regulatory RNAs, play a major role in the regulation of gene expression through post-transcriptional repression, and appear to be important in PC. The expression of miR-200 family has been established by us and others both in vitro and in vivo as one of the most intensively studied epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related miRNAs that target multiple genes (12,17â€“20)*. Recent evidence has also shown down-regulation of miR-200 family by ZEB1 due to suppression of stemness-inhibiting miRNAs in the 38 different carcinoma cell lines of the NCI-60 cell line panel (20). 3:These cells were stored in multiple vials in liquid nitrogen for our use. CDF was synthesized as described in our earlier publications (22,23), and BR-DIM, a formulated DIM with higher bioavailabilty (24), was obtained from Dr. Michael Zeligs (BioResponse, LLC, Boulder, CO, USA). Both of these novel agents have been extensively used in our laboratory for the treatment of most cancer cells in vitro and in vivo including PC, as shown by many of our published papers (12,24â€“31)*. 4:MT1-MMP is often expressed in tumor cells with significant invasive properties, and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. In contrast, PTEN, a well-known tumor suppressor gene, has been reported to be lost in tumors (12)*. We examined the basal level of MT1-MMP and PTEN expression in six human PC cell lines. MT1-MMP expression was highly elevated in AsPC-1, PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2-GR cells, and moderately elevated in MIAPaCa-2 cells compared with BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells (Figure 1A). 5:Figure 2A and 2B demonstrate the morphological differences in MIAPaCa-2 and MIAPaCa-2-GR cells. The MIAPaCa-2 cells were exposed to gemcitabine every other week for a period of 6 months which led to this mesenchymal phenotype as reported earlier (12,34)*. MIAPaCa-2 and MIAPaCa2-GR cells treated with either BR-DIM or CDF for 24, 48 and 72h (Figure 2A and 2B) were photographed. 6:Previous studies have shown that PC cell lines exhibit significantly lower levels of expression of miR-200 family, which was associated with increased EMT, suggesting that miR-200 play an important role in several key aspects of tumor initiation and progression (12,41). Others have reported down-regulation of miR-200 family expression through Smad signaling-dependent manner during the progression of renal fibrosis (42). 7:Moreover, the inactivation in the expression of miR-200c resulted in the acquisition of EMT phenotype and tumor cell aggressiveness, which is consistent with our previous findings (12)*. Based on our observations, we conclude the importance of the miR-200c miRNA because it may serve as the key regulators of MT1-MMP and PTEN expression, and that the restoration of PTEN expression and down-regulation of MT1-MMP could be easily achieved with both CDF and BR-DIM treatment, which was mediated through re-expression of miR-200c although CDF was found to be superior than BR-DIM.",MM & Res & Disc,Dependent,Yes,>1,Carcinogenesis,2012,5/29/2012,10.1093/carcin/bgs189,+Misconduct by Author +Misconduct - Official Investigation and/or Finding +Manipulation of Images +Investigation by Company/Institution +Falsification/Fabrication of Image,"Authorship, Images",,,Uses_Results,"The citing paper explicitly discusses the re-expression of miR-200 family, PTEN, and MT1-MMP in pancreatic cancer cells, which are core components of the retracted paper's findings.

Specifically, it cites the retracted paper's observation that miR-200 family members are downregulated in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells, which is consistent with the citing paper's findings of decreased miR-200 family expression in its mouse model.

Answer 3:
[Evidence from Citing Paper: ""Our previous study has shown that Notch pathway could be one of the target of miR-200b [31]. Consistent with this notion, we found loss of miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c expression in the tumors of KCI mice, suggesting that activated Notch pathway could also be due to the loss of expression of miR-200 family. Moreover, we found that over-expression of miR-200b inhibited cell growth in Rink-1 cells (Fig. 6B). Most interestingly, recent studies have shown that the miR-200 family regulates EMT by targeting ZEB expression. We have reported earlier that miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c are down-regulated in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells, which have high expression of Notch pathway and contributed to the acquisition of EMT phenotype [33,34].""]

Our previous study has shown that activation of Notch and NF-ÎºB were involved in the development of PDAC in the compound K-Ras and Ink4a/Arf deficient transgenic mice (Wang et al., 2011a)*. Recently, we found over-expression of several miRNAs, such as miR-21, miR-221, miR-27, and miR-155, and down-regulation in the expression of multiple miRNAs including miR-216a, miR-216b, miR-217, and miR-146a in tumors derived from the compound K-Ras and Ink4a/Arf deficient transgenic mice (Ali et al., 2011). 2:The LSL-K-Ras strain was bred to the following strains: Pdx1-Cre, INK4a/Arf as previously described (Wang et al., 2011a)*. Pancreata were collected and processed for analysis. Tumor tissues harvested from this experiment was used for histologic, immunohistochemical, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blotting analysis. 3:When LSL-KRas mice are bred with transgenic mice which express Cre-recombinase under the control of the Pdx1 promoter, expression of Cre-recombinase in pancreatic progenitor cells removes the floxed transcriptional STOP cassette, leading to the activation of the oncogenic K-Ras allele downstream of its own endogenous promoter. Our previously published study has shown that pancreatic tumors did not develop in 24- and 30-week-old Pdx1-Cre:deletion of Ink4a/Arf (CI) and LSLK-Ras :Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice, respectively (Wang et al., 2011a). However, mice from LSL-KRas :Pdx1-Cre: Ink4a/Arf (KCI) animals were found to form solid pancreatic tumors ranging in diameter from 4 to 10 mm between 45 and 80 days (Wang et al., 2011a)*. 4:It has been reported that PDGF-D signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in many human cancers including pancreatic cancer (Wang et al., 2009, 2011a). Therefore, we examined the levels of PDGF-D expression in our transgenic mice tissues.

Recently, Nrdp1 has been shown to downregulate in CRC and appears to inhibit CRC cell growth through p27 [18]*. However, whether Nrdp1 may also regulate cell invasion in CRC has not been studied before. 2: To figure out the relationship of Nrdp1 and MMP7 levels in CRC, we performed a correlation test in 20 CRC patients. A strong negative correlation was detected (Fig. 1c, =âˆ’0.82, p<0.001), suggesting the possibility of a regulation pathway between Nrdp1 and MMP7. Since Nrdp1 mediates the degradation of ErbB3 to antagonize EGFR signaling [17] and since Nrdp1 has recently been shown to inhibit CRC cell growth through p27 [18]*, we thus hypothesize that Nrdp1 may inhibit MMP7 through its regulation on EGFR signaling. We were thus prompted to examine this hypothesis. 3: Nrdp1 has been shown to mediate the degradation of ErbB3 ,and loss of Nrdp1 may lead to ErbB3 overexpression and, thus, activation of ERK/MAPK and PI3K pathways.

Recently, we have developed a novel synthetic analogue of curcumin, 3,4-difluoro-benzo-curcumin [we named it as Difluorinated-Curcumin or in short CDF [10,11]], which showed greater bioavailability in pancreatic tissues, and also inhibited cell growth, DNA-binding activity of NF-kB, Akt, COX-2, and the production of PGE2 and VEGF, and caused induction of miR-200 and inactivation of miR-21 in PC cells [12]*. Since miR-200 is associated with the acquisition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is also believed to be associated with CSCs or cancer stem-like cells, here we investigated the effects of CDF on CSC function. 2:We selected the concentration of 20 nmol/L of gemcitabine and 4 mmol/L of curcumin or CDF to conduct clonogenic assay following our previous publication [12]*. The results demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in clonogenicity of AsPC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 cells treated with curcumin and CDF, but not with gemcitabine (Figure 2A). 3:The inhibition of cell growth could in part be due to better cellular uptake, retention and reduced metabolic inactivation of CDF by PC cells, which is consistent with our published findings on cellular and animal pharmacokinetics data [10,11]. Our previous reports indicate that CDF inhibits NF-kB and COX-2 activity in PC cells in vitro [12]*. Here we confirm these observations in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. 4:Among many miRNAs, miR-21, commonly considered as an oncogene, is over-expressed in many solid tumors including PC and has been reported to be associated with tumor progression, poor survival and drug resistance [13,14,26,27]. In our previous report, we have demonstrated that the expression of miR-21 is up-regulated in gemcitabine-resistant PC cells and that its expression can be significantly down-regulated by CDF treatment in vitro [12]*. The increased expression of miR-21 is known to be associated with inactivation of PTEN, a know tumor suppressor gene, resulting in activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, leading to aggressive tumor growth [15,28]. 5:Down-regulation of miR-200 by siRNA technique has been shown to be associated with EMT phenotype while reexpression of miR-200 can result in the reversal of EMT phenotype [29,30]. In our previous publication [12], we demonstrated that CDF treatment could re-express miR-200 in PC cells. Here we showed, for the first time, that CDF can upregulate miR-200b and miR-200c in tumor remnants in vivo, consistent with significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model when CDF was used in combination with gemcitabine. 6:Clonogenic assay was conducted to examine the effect of drugs on cell growth in PC cells, as described previously [12]*. 56104 cells were plated in a six-well plate.

It has been reported that high expression of miR-21 results in decreased expression of PTEN in cancers [38, 39]*. It has also documented that the miR-21 exerts anti-apoptotic, proliferative, invasive and angiogenic properties in cancer cells [37, 40-42]. 2:Recently, we have developed a novel synthetic compound of curcumin, 3,4-difluoro-benzocurcumin, referred to as Difluorinated-Curcumin (CDF), which shows greater bioavailability in multiple tissues such as pancreas and prostate compared to its parental compound curcumin [98, 105]. It has been demonstrated that CDF inhibits cell growth, NF-B DNA-binding activity, COX-2, Akt, and the production of VEGF and PGE2 in pancreatic cancer cells [38, 39]. Moreover, CDF has shown to inhibit the tumor growth of human pancreatic cancer in mouse xenograft models, consistent with inhibition of NF-B, VEGF, EZH2, COX2, and CSC characteristics [39]. More importantly, CDF appears to increase the expression of let-7, miR-26a, miR-101 and miR-200, and decrease miR-21, which is consistent with the inhibition of pancreatosphere formation and the expression of CSC signature proteins in CSC-like sphere cells of pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer [38, 39, 106-108]*.
