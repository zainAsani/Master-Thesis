15934135,17250953,"1alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced DNA methylation suppresses the human CYP27B1 gene",Yes,No,"1: Expression of CYP27B1 is negatively regulated by Vitamin D[1,25(OH)2D3] (Murayama et al., 2004; Murayama et al., 1998; Takeyama et al., 1997). We recently reported that a bHLHtype activator, VDR-interacting repressor (VDIR), directly binds to the negative Vitamin D response element (1nVDRE) in the human CYP27B1 gene promoter, thus activating its transcription (Fig. 1) (Murayama et al., 2004). However, ligand-induced association between VDR and VDIR results in ligand-induced repression (transrepression) of the CYP27B1 gene expression. This transrepression is associated with VDIR switching from a co-activator complex containing histone acetyltransferase (HAT) to a co-repressor complex containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) (Murayama et al., 2004). 2:Transrepression at the CYP27B1 promoter was monitored in transfection assays using a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of a human CYP27B1 gene promoter segment (∼700 bp upstream region of the transcription start site) containing two consensus 1nVDRE sequences recognized by VDIR. Using gene-specific RNAi, we found that endogenous VDR, VDIR and WSTF are involved in the ligand-induced suppression of the CYP27B1 gene promoter (Fig. 2A) that is consistent with previously shown physical association of these three factors (Kitagawa et al., 2003; Murayama et al., 2004). 3:To test whether WSTF was recruited to VDIR via liganded VDR in the nuclei of living cells, we performed a ChIP assay on the endogenous CYP27B1 gene promoter. In agreement with previous reports (Kitagawa et al., 2003; Murayama et al., 2004), VDIR was constitutively bound to the 1nVDRE (Fig. 2B). As WSTF RNAi remarkably attenuated the promoter occupancy by VDR in the absence of ligand, WSTF appeared to facilitate the binding of unliganded VDR at the 1nVDRE (Fig. 2B). 4:Histone deacetylation by recruited HDACs to VDR/VDIR at the 1nVDRE is a critical step for remodeling chromatin structure at the CYP27B1 gene promoter in VDR-mediated transrepression (Murayama et al., 2004). However, TSA (a HDAC inhibitor) could not fully abrogate 1,25 (OH)2D3-induced transrepression (Fig. 4A), suggesting that an additional mechanism may contribute to this transcriptional repression. 5:We have shown that the CYP27B1 gene nVDRE is composed of two E-box like motifs (Murayama et al., 2004). This E-box like motif(s), serving as a VDIR binding site, also appears to confer a negative response to 1,25(OH)2D3 at other VDR target gene promoters (Kim et al., in press). 6:It has been suggested that ligand-unbound VDR/RXR on the VDRE mainly associates with a HDAC complex to repress target genes (Murayama et al., 2004). According to this model of a positive VDRE, ligand binding leads to co-repressor dissociation from VDR. In contrast, the WINAC assists recruitment of HDAC co-repressor complex in VDIR-mediated transrepression on a negative VDRE (Fujiki et al., 2005).",Others,Dependent,Yes,>1,Mol Cell Endocrinol,2007,1/26/2007,10.1016/j.mce.2006.12.014,+Investigation by Journal/Publisher +Investigation by Company/Institution +Duplication of/in Image +Concerns/Issues About Data,"Data, Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process","+Manipulation of Images

The cell lines have been tested and authenticated in the core facility ""Applied Genomics Technology Center"" at Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, on March 13, 2009. The method used for testing was short tandem repeat (STR) profiling using the PowerPlex 16 System from Promega. 2:CDF, a synthetic derivative of curcumin, was synthesized as described in our earlier publications (17, 19)*. Antibodies Biosystems) following manufacturer's protocol. Five nanograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed and real-time PCR reactions were carried out in 10 mL of reaction mixture as described previously (17, 22)* using AB StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using Ct method and were normalized by RNU6B or RNU48 expression in each sample. 3:To investigate the effect of CDF on cell survival of pancreatic cancer cells, we conducted MTT assays using AsPC-1, MiaPaCa-2 cells, and MiaPaCa-2 tumor sphere cells. The results indicate that CDF significantly inhibited cell survival in a dose-dependent manner in AsPC-1, MiaPaCa-2 cells, and MiaPaCa-2 tumor sphere cells (Fig. 1A). These results suggests that CDF could exert a pronounced cell growth–inhibitory effect on pancreatic cancer cell growth and proliferation, which is consistent with our previously published reports (17, 18)*. 4:To determine the mRNA expression of EZH2, Notch-1, EpCAM, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4, 2 mg of total RNAs extracted from each sample (pancreatic cancer cells of xenograft tumor sample) were used for reverse transcription (RT) reaction in 20 mL of reaction volume using a reverse transcription system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SYBR Green Assay kit (Applied Biosystems) was used for real-time PCR reaction, following manufacturer's protocol. Sequences of PCR primers were described previously (17, 22)*. Data were analyzed using Ct method and were normalized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression in each sample. 5:We carried out animal experiment using orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer in which the tumors were derived from MiaPaCa-2 cells injected into the pancreas. We found that group with 5 mg CDF per mouse could significantly decrease tumor size and weight, compared with the control group or group with 2.5 mg CDF per mouse (Fig. 6A), which is consistent with our previous findings (17)*. Interestingly, we found that CDF treatment could decrease the protein expression of EZH2, CD44, EpCAM, Notch-1, and Nanog in pancreatic tumor remnant (Fig. 6B). 6:Emerging evidence also suggests that miR-200 serve as a potential tumor suppressor, primarily by repressing the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype during the development and progression of tumors (17, 22, 35, 40, 41)*. Decreased expression of miR-200 has been observed inmanytumors includingpancreaticcancer, whichis associated with tumor invasion and metastasis (35, 42, 43). 7:These findings are also consistent with treatment of cells with CDF, suggesting that miRNAs that are lost in pancreatic cancer cells could be reexpressed using our novel agent CDF (18, 19). In our previous reports, we showed that CDF inhibited tumor growth by attenuating multiple targets such as NF-kB, Akt, COX-2 signaling pathways, EMT phenotype and CSC function, PTEN, miR-21, and miR-200 in vitro and in vivo (17, 18)*, which is consistent with our current findings showing that CDF could inhibit the expression of EZH2, Notch-1, and Oct4 through reexpression of let-7a,b,c,d, miR-26a, and miR-101 in the pancreatic cancer cells as well as in tumor remnants.

In further support of this putative role, Mybbp1a was recently identified as a component of several co-repressor and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, including Ret-CoR and esBAF complex [10,11]*, that mostly contain common constituents such as HDACs. While the roles of Mybbp1a in these repressor complexes remain unclear, it may likely serve similar epigenetic and cellular functions. 2:We sought to further dissect the molecular basis of Mybbp1a’s inhibitory role in rDNA gene transcription. Given the requirement of HDACs in maintaining an inactive state of rDNA promoters [26,30], and the reported association of Mybbp1a with several HDACs-containing co-repressor complexes [10]*, we next aimed to assess whether HDACs contribute to Mybbp1a-mediated rDNA gene silencing.

17804744,24418574,FOXM1 and its oncogenic signaling in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis,No,No,"1:This phenotype was associated with diminished expression of S phase-promoting cyclin A2 and M phasepromoting cyclin B1 proteins, demonstrating that FOXM1 promotes prostate tumor cell proliferation by regulating the expression of cyclins [71]. Furthermore, several studies demonstrated that FOXM1 can regulate cyclin and CDK expression in human pancreatic cancer cells, as downregulation of FOXM1 expression inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth by suppressing cyclin B, cyclin D1, Cdk2, and Cdc25a expression [78,79]*. 2:In addition, blockade of FOXM1 expression in human prostate cancer cells can upregulate p27 protein expression and cause a reduction in and reduce cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth on soft agar [71]. Moreover, Wang et al. [78]* found that downregulation of FOXM1 expression decreased the pancreatic cancer cell population in S phase and inhibited the growth of the cells by increasing p21 and p27 expression. 3:Moreover, FOXM1 overexpression increased VEGF expression in gastric and breast cancer cells, whereas blockade of FOXM1 expression did the opposite [88,90]. Recently, Wang et al. [78]* found that downregulation of FOXM1 expression reduced VEGF expression in pancreatic cancer cells, resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis. Consistent with these findings, we demonstrated that promotion of pancreatic cancer angiogenesis by FOXM1 was directly and strongly correlated with transactivation of VEGF. 4:Authors have documented a similar role for FOXM1 in the regulation of MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9 expression as well as cell migration and invasion in other malignancies, including colorectal and breast carcinoma [13,97]. Consistent with these findings, recent studies indicated that FOXM1 contributes to pancreatic cancer invasion by enhancing MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression and that suppression of FOXM1 expression leads to reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in pancreatic cancer cells, which are associated with an overall decrease in cancer cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis [78,79]*. 5:In addition to regulation of the expression of proteolysis-related genes, several studies have demonstrated that FOXM1 promotes pancreatic tumor invasion and metastasis by contributing to angiogenesis and pancreatic cancer cell EMT [78]*. In summary, these findings provide evidence that FOXM1 promotes pancreatic cancer metastasis via regulation of multiple steps in the process in tumor invasion and metastasis. 6:They also confirmed that FOXM1 is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. These data suggest that overexpression of FOXM1 not only promotes migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of pancreatic cancer cells but also leads to EMT and a CSC phenotype [78,79,108]*. Recently, Xia and colleagues demonstrated that FOXM1 protein and mRNA expression was higher in pancreatic tumors than in paired adjacent normal pancreatic tissue specimens. 7:To investigate the use of RNAi to block FOXM1 expression and its effect on the biology of human pancreatic cancer cells, Wang et al. [78]* employed RNAi systems to knock down FOXM1 gene expression in pancreatic cancer cells. They found that RNAi silencing of the FOXM1 gene suppressed the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF, which was accompanied by marked inhibition of tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.

17804744,20354770,FoxM1 is a novel target of a natural agent in pancreatic cancer,Yes,No,"1:Pancreatic cancer has been shown to have activated Forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) signaling pathway (7)*. The FoxM1 belongs to a family of evolutionary conserved transcriptional regulators that were characterized by the presence of a DNA-binding domain called the forkhead box or winged helix domain (8,9). 2:The total RNA from treatment cells was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified by RNeasy Mini Kit and RNase-free DNase Set (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The primers used in the PCR reaction, and real-time PCR amplications were performed as described earlier (7)*. 3:FoxM1 siRNA and siRNA control were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The FoxM1 cDNA plasmid was purchased from OriGene Technologies Inc. (Rockville MD). Human pancreatic cancer cells were transfected with FoxM1 siRNA and cDNA, respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 as described earlier (7)*. 4:In order to further understand the molecular mechanism involved in genistein-induced apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells, alterations in the cell survival pathway genes were investigated. Our previous studies have shown that FoxM1 signaling is over-expressed in pancreatic cancer and is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis, potentiation of cell growth, and angiogenesis, and thus considered as a putative target for drug development (7)*. Therefore, we investigated whether genistein could regulate FoxM1 signaling pathways using molecular and mechanistic approaches in this study. 5:Our previous study has shown that MMP-9 was regulated by FoxM1 in pancreatic cancer (7), and since we found that genistein can down-regulate the expression of FoxM1, we tested whether genistein could decrease MMP-9 activity as assessed by ELISA. We found about 2-3-fold decrease in the activity of MMP-9 in genistein-treated pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig.5A). These results are consistent with our observation on the down-regulation of FoxM1, which indeed leads to the down-regulation of both MMP-9 levels and its activity as reported earlier (7)*. 6:To further investigate whether genistein has any effect on VEGF, whose expression is transcriptionally regulated by FoxM1 (7,21,24)*, ELISA was performed to examine the activity of VEGF. We found that genistein could lead to a decrease in the levels of VEGF secreted in the culture medium (Fig. 5B). 7:FoxM1 signaling has been demonstrated to maintain a balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting that abnormal activation of FoxM1 gene is one of the “hallmarks” of human malignancies (9).

In SKBR3 cells expressing shRNAs targeting RNF41 or control proteins (RFP or luciferase), we assessed HER3 levels after treatment with a negative control IgG or IgG 95. In the presence of the negative control IgG, cells expressing RNF41 shRNA exhibited higher HER3 levels than those expressing control shRNAs (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with previous reports (45, 46)* and with on-target shRNA activity. Moreover, down-regulation of HER3 levels was attenuated in cells Because RNF41 shRNAs attenuated the anti-proliferative activity of IgG 95, we tested whether they also attenuated the effects of IgG 95 on the ubiquitination and down-regulation of HER3. In SKBR3 cells expressing shRNAs targeting RNF41 or control proteins (RFP or luciferase), we assessed HER3 levels after treatment with a negative control IgG or IgG 95. In the presence of the negative control IgG, cells expressing RNF41 shRNA exhibited higher HER3 levels than those expressing control shRNAs (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with previous reports (45, 46)* and with on-target shRNA activity. Moreover, down-regulation of HER3 levels was attenuated in cells. 2: In summary, our data highlight a functional contribution of RNF41 to the anti-proliferative activity of IgG 95 in SKBR3 cells and support a dual role for this E3 ligase in the regulation of HER3. First, as also described previously (44, 45, 47)*, RNF41 regulates resting HER3 levels, as knockdown of RNF41 results in an increase in total HER3. 3: In HER2-amplifiedSKBR3cells,RNF41playsthedualroleof controlling both total HER3 levels and antibody-mediated degradation. We predict that these two functions may render RNF41-depleted cancer cell lines more aggressive as a result of higherHER3levels,asseenelsewhere(45,46),andlesssensitive to antibodies like IgG 95 that depend on RNF41 for their efficacy, especially in the context of HER2 amplification where HER3signalingisdriveninaligand-independentmanner.Conversely, given that RNF41 knockdown increases the proliferative response to NRG1 (46), cancers exhibiting low RNF41 and ligand-dependent signaling would likely respond to NRG1 competitive anti-HER3 antibodies. 5: Based on our observations that IgG 95 induces ubiquitination and down-regulation of HER3, we furthered explored the mechanism of IgG 95 function by performing a UPS-targeted functional genomic screen and found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41 is at least partially responsible for the anti-proliferative effects of IgG 95.

20388782,22637745,Re-expression of miR-200 by novel approaches regulates the expression of PTEN and MT1-MMP in pancreatic cancer,Yes,No,"1:Besides the deregulation of MT1-MMP, the loss of expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is a ubiquitous tumor suppressor gene, has been shown to correlate with tumor aggressiveness and was also associated with up-regulation of miRNA expression such as miR-21 (12,13)*. Additionally, over-expression of MT1-MMP was found to be associated with loss of PTEN expression in prostate cancer cells derived from mice through the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (14); whereas in renal cell carcinoma, loss of PTEN induces HIF-2α transcriptional activity through antagonism of PI3K signaling (15). 2:Emerging evidence suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs), highly conserved and small non-coding regulatory RNAs, play a major role in the regulation of gene expression through post-transcriptional repression, and appear to be important in PC. The expression of miR-200 family has been established by us and others both in vitro and in vivo as one of the most intensively studied epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related miRNAs that target multiple genes (12,17–20)*. Recent evidence has also shown down-regulation of miR-200 family by ZEB1 due to suppression of stemness-inhibiting miRNAs in the 38 different carcinoma cell lines of the NCI-60 cell line panel (20). 3:These cells were stored in multiple vials in liquid nitrogen for our use. CDF was synthesized as described in our earlier publications (22,23), and BR-DIM, a formulated DIM with higher bioavailabilty (24), was obtained from Dr. Michael Zeligs (BioResponse, LLC, Boulder, CO, USA). Both of these novel agents have been extensively used in our laboratory for the treatment of most cancer cells in vitro and in vivo including PC, as shown by many of our published papers (12,24–31)*. 4:MT1-MMP is often expressed in tumor cells with significant invasive properties, and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. In contrast, PTEN, a well-known tumor suppressor gene, has been reported to be lost in tumors (12)*. We examined the basal level of MT1-MMP and PTEN expression in six human PC cell lines. MT1-MMP expression was highly elevated in AsPC-1, PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2-GR cells, and moderately elevated in MIAPaCa-2 cells compared with BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells (Figure 1A). 5:Figure 2A and 2B demonstrate the morphological differences in MIAPaCa-2 and MIAPaCa-2-GR cells. The MIAPaCa-2 cells were exposed to gemcitabine every other week for a period of 6 months which led to this mesenchymal phenotype as reported earlier (12,34)*. MIAPaCa-2 and MIAPaCa2-GR cells treated with either BR-DIM or CDF for 24, 48 and 72h (Figure 2A and 2B) were photographed. 6:Previous studies have shown that PC cell lines exhibit significantly lower levels of expression of miR-200 family, which was associated with increased EMT, suggesting that miR-200 play an important role in several key aspects of tumor initiation and progression (12,41). Others have reported down-regulation of miR-200 family expression through Smad signaling-dependent manner during the progression of renal fibrosis (42). 7:Moreover, the inactivation in the expression of miR-200c resulted in the acquisition of EMT phenotype and tumor cell aggressiveness, which is consistent with our previous findings (12)*. Based on our observations, we conclude the importance of the miR-200c miRNA because it may serve as the key regulators of MT1-MMP and PTEN expression, and that the restoration of PTEN expression and down-regulation of MT1-MMP could be easily achieved with both CDF and BR-DIM treatment, which was mediated through re-expression of miR-200c although CDF was found to be superior than BR-DIM.",MM & Res & Disc,Dependent,Yes,>1,Carcinogenesis,2012,5/29/2012,10.1093/carcin/bgs189,+Misconduct by Author +Misconduct - Official Investigation and/or Finding +Manipulation of Images +Investigation by Company/Institution +Falsification/Fabrication of Image,"Authorship, Images",,,Other,"The citing paper discusses the role of miR-200 family and its regulation of PTEN and MT1-MMP expression, citing previous studies (e.g., ""as shown by many of our published papers (12,24–31)""), but it does not explicitly state that it is using data, results, or methods from <RA>, nor does it directly compare its findings to those of <RA>.

Our previous study has shown that activation of Notch and NF-κB were involved in the development of PDAC in the compound K-Ras and Ink4a/Arf deficient transgenic mice (Wang et al., 2011a)*. Recently, we found over-expression of several miRNAs, such as miR-21, miR-221, miR-27, and miR-155, and down-regulation in the expression of multiple miRNAs including miR-216a, miR-216b, miR-217, and miR-146a in tumors derived from the compound K-Ras and Ink4a/Arf deficient transgenic mice (Ali et al., 2011). 2:The LSL-K-Ras strain was bred to the following strains: Pdx1-Cre, INK4a/Arf as previously described (Wang et al., 2011a)*. Pancreata were collected and processed for analysis. Tumor tissues harvested from this experiment was used for histologic, immunohistochemical, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blotting analysis. 3:When LSL-KRas mice are bred with transgenic mice which express Cre-recombinase under the control of the Pdx1 promoter, expression of Cre-recombinase in pancreatic progenitor cells removes the floxed transcriptional STOP cassette, leading to the activation of the oncogenic K-Ras allele downstream of its own endogenous promoter. Our previously published study has shown that pancreatic tumors did not develop in 24- and 30-week-old Pdx1-Cre:deletion of Ink4a/Arf (CI) and LSLK-Ras :Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice, respectively (Wang et al., 2011a). However, mice from LSL-KRas :Pdx1-Cre: Ink4a/Arf (KCI) animals were found to form solid pancreatic tumors ranging in diameter from 4 to 10 mm between 45 and 80 days (Wang et al., 2011a)*. 4:It has been reported that PDGF-D signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in many human cancers including pancreatic cancer (Wang et al., 2009, 2011a).

25008564,25596089,Retracted: Insulin-like growth factor 1 promotes growth of gastric cancer by inhibiting foxo1 nuclear retention,No,No,"1:In the nucleus, FoxO1 directly activates cell-cycle inhibitors, e.g., p27 [9], to inhibit cell growth [8]. Thus, nuclear form of FoxO1 generally has an inhibitory effect on the growth of most types of cells, while presence of FoxO1 in cytosol suggests loss of suppression on cell growth [8, 10–14]*. 2:AGS cells were transfected with a constitutively nuclear FoxO1-expressing plasmid, as has been previously described [10, 11, 15]*. The transfected cells were termed as AGSnFoxO1. AGS-nFoxO1 expressed high levels of nuclear FoxO1, which cannot be phosphorylated due to a defect on phosphorylation site. 3:Since nuclear presence of FoxO1 is critical for cell growth inhibition, we thus examined whether IGF-1 may affect cellular location of FoxO1 in GC cells. We found that IGF-1 induced nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 in AGS cells (Fig. 4a), suggesting a possibility of this regulatory axis to be responsible for the IGF-1-induced GC cell growth. To prove it, we transduced the AGS cells with a sustained nuclear FoxO1 expressing plasmid, as has been previously described [10, 11, 15].

24867101,25330950,Retracted: Nrdp1 inhibits metastasis of colorectal cancer cells by EGFR signaling-dependent MMP7 modulation,No,No,"1: Nrdp1 has been shown to mediate the degradation of ErbB3, and a loss of Nrdp1 may lead to receptor overexpression and disease progression [17]. Recently, Nrdp1 has been shown to downregulate in CRC and appears to inhibit CRC cell growth through p27 [18]*. However, whether Nrdp1 may also regulate cell invasion in CRC has not been studied before. 2: To figure out the relationship of Nrdp1 and MMP7 levels in CRC, we performed a correlation test in 20 CRC patients. A strong negative correlation was detected (Fig. 1c, =−0.82, p<0.001), suggesting the possibility of a regulation pathway between Nrdp1 and MMP7. Since Nrdp1 mediates the degradation of ErbB3 to antagonize EGFR signaling [17] and since Nrdp1 has recently been shown to inhibit CRC cell growth through p27 [18]*, we thus hypothesize that Nrdp1 may inhibit MMP7 through its regulation on EGFR signaling. We were thus prompted to examine this hypothesis. 3: Nrdp1 has been shown to mediate the degradation of ErbB3 ,and loss of Nrdp1 may lead to ErbB3 overexpression and, thus, activation of ERK/MAPK and PI3K pathways. Interestingly, Nrdp1 has recently been shown to decrease in CRC and to inhibit CRC cell growth through p27 [18]*. Nevertheless, whether Nrdp1 plays a role in the control of CRC metastasis has not been examined. 4: Of note, a recent publication has reached similar results with us [18]*, but it focuses on the inhibitory role of Nrdp1 on CRC cell growth. It is not surprising that here we found that Nrdp1 also has an inhibitory role on CRC invasion, since both share the same signaling pathway, ERK/MAPK, which regulates multiple cellular events relating to cell growth, apoptosis, and metastasis.","Introduction, Result, Discussion",Dependent,Yes,>1,Tumour Biol,2015,10/22/2014,10.1007/s13277-014-2726-y,+Investigation by Journal/Publisher +Fake Peer Review,Peer_Review_and_Publishing_Process,"+Investigation by Journal/Publisher

The role of chromatin-remodelling complexes in the alteration of chromatin structure over much of the cell cycle has been studied (Baumann et al, 2007; Groth et al, 2007). 2:To investigate whether the transactivation function of activated ERα varies across the cell cycle, we tested the transactivation function of endogenous ERα activated by 17β-oestradiol (E2) in synchronized MCF7 (ERα-positive) or MDA-MB231 cells (ERα-negative breast carcinoma cell line; Fig 1A; supplementary Fig S1 online). The synchronization of each phase was confirmed by DNA content analysis using flow cytometry, as reported previously (Takezawa et al, 2007)*. In a luciferase assay with an ERE-TATA reporter (a PEST sequence was tagged to luciferase for rapid protein degradation (Hill et al, 2001)), the transcriptional activity of ERα seemed to be unaltered at G1/S (Fig 1B, compare lane 4 with lane 2 in asynchronous cells), whereas at G2/M, its activity was significantly lower in MCF7 cells. 3:A switching factor seems to associate, at least transiently, with these complexes and is presumably functional at specific cell-cycle stages. The appearance of such a factor might be under cell-cycle regulation, similar to a recently characterized cell-cycle-dependent co-repressor (Ret-CoR) that represses the constitutively transrepressive-type nuclear receptor (Takezawa et al, 2007)*. 4: Cells were synchronized 24 h after spreading (for suspension culture, at a cell density of 2 × 10 /ml) by treatment with 2.5 mM thymidine (Wako, Osaka, Japan) at G1/S phase or 10 ng/ml demecolcine (Wako) at G2/M phase under phenol red-free DMEM containing 5% serum.

Recently, we have developed a novel synthetic analogue of curcumin, 3,4-difluoro-benzo-curcumin [we named it as Difluorinated-Curcumin or in short CDF [10,11]], which showed greater bioavailability in pancreatic tissues, and also inhibited cell growth, DNA-binding activity of NF-kB, Akt, COX-2, and the production of PGE2 and VEGF, and caused induction of miR-200 and inactivation of miR-21 in PC cells [12]*. Since miR-200 is associated with the acquisition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is also believed to be associated with CSCs or cancer stem-like cells, here we investigated the effects of CDF on CSC function. 2:We selected the concentration of 20 nmol/L of gemcitabine and 4 mmol/L of curcumin or CDF to conduct clonogenic assay following our previous publication [12]*. The results demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in clonogenicity of AsPC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 cells treated with curcumin and CDF, but not with gemcitabine (Figure 2A). 3:The inhibition of cell growth could in part be due to better cellular uptake, retention and reduced metabolic inactivation of CDF by PC cells, which is consistent with our published findings on cellular and animal pharmacokinetics data [10,11]. Our previous reports indicate that CDF inhibits NF-kB and COX-2 activity in PC cells in vitro [12]*. Here we confirm these observations in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. 4:Among many miRNAs, miR-21, commonly considered as an oncogene, is over-expressed in many solid tumors including PC and has been reported to be associated with tumor progression, poor survival and drug resistance [13,14,26,27]. In our previous report, we have demonstrated that the expression of miR-21 is up-regulated in gemcitabine-resistant PC cells and that its expression can be significantly down-regulated by CDF treatment in vitro [12]*. The increased expression of miR-21 is known to be associated with inactivation of PTEN, a know tumor suppressor gene, resulting in activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, leading to aggressive tumor growth [15,28]. 5:Down-regulation of miR-200 by siRNA technique has been shown to be associated with EMT phenotype while reexpression of miR-200 can result in the reversal of EMT phenotype [29,30]. In our previous publication [12], we demonstrated that CDF treatment could re-express miR-200 in PC cells. Here we showed, for the first time, that CDF can upregulate miR-200b and miR-200c in tumor remnants in vivo, consistent with significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model when CDF was used in combination with gemcitabine. 6:Clonogenic assay was conducted to examine the effect of drugs on cell growth in PC cells, as described previously [12]*. 56104 cells were plated in a six-well plate. After 72h of exposure to 20 nmol/L of gemcitabine, 4 mmol/L of CDF or curcumin, the cells were trypsinized, and 1,000 single viable cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes. 7:MTT assay was conducted using AsPC-1, AsPC-1-GTR, MIAPaCa-2, and MIAPaCa-2-GTR as described previously [12]* after 72 h of treatment. Combination index and Isobologram for combination treatment were also calculated and plotted using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom) to determine synergy based on the method of Chou and Talalay [32]. 8:Proteins were extracted from all four cell lines and also from animal tumor tissues as described previously [12]. Relative level of ABCG2 was evaluated for all four cell lines.

WSTF is crucial for gene regulation by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and is expressed during embryogenesis (12, 13)*. WSTF is also reported to assemble with Snf2h to form WICH, an ISWI-type chromatin complex (14). 2:The reported role of WSTF in gene regulation (9, 11) was then tested by expression analysis of the key enzymes regulating vitamin D biosynthesis and catabolism, which are the 25(OH)1α-hydroxylase [1α(OH)ase] and 25(OH)24-hydroxylase [24(OH)ase] genes (18). Activation of the VDR by binding of 1α, 25(OH)2D3 served as a transcriptional repressor of 1α(OH)ase, but was a transcriptional activator of 24(OH)ase (12, 13, 18)*. 3:The present findings suggest that WSTF is a chromatin remodeler that is essential for physiological functions of certain sequence-specific transcriptional regulators other than VDR (12, 13)* (Fig. 4F). Although WSTF was indispensable for proper in vitro function of transcriptional activators specific for cardiovascular development like other BAF components (12, 30), WSTF embryos did not exhibit the same abnormalities seen in the embryos deficient in either BAF components (10, 21) or cardiac activators (22, 24, 25). 4:Primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated and cultured as described in ref. 13*.

It has been reported that high expression of miR-21 results in decreased expression of PTEN in cancers [38, 39]*. It has also documented that the miR-21 exerts anti-apoptotic, proliferative, invasive and angiogenic properties in cancer cells [37, 40-42]. 2:Recently, we have developed a novel synthetic compound of curcumin, 3,4-difluoro-benzocurcumin, referred to as Difluorinated-Curcumin (CDF), which shows greater bioavailability in multiple tissues such as pancreas and prostate compared to its parental compound curcumin [98, 105]. It has been demonstrated that CDF inhibits cell growth, NF-B DNA-binding activity, COX-2, Akt, and the production of VEGF and PGE2 in pancreatic cancer cells [38, 39]. Moreover, CDF has shown to inhibit the tumor growth of human pancreatic cancer in mouse xenograft models, consistent with inhibition of NF-B, VEGF, EZH2, COX2, and CSC characteristics [39]. More importantly, CDF appears to increase the expression of let-7, miR-26a, miR-101 and miR-200, and decrease miR-21, which is consistent with the inhibition of pancreatosphere formation and the expression of CSC signature proteins in CSC-like sphere cells of pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer [38, 39, 106-108]*.
